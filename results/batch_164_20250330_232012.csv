"A query unrelated to the provided context!

To answer your question, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure that ensures efficient insertion and deletion operations. In an AVL tree, two types of imbalances can occur:

1. **Left-heavy imbalance**: When a node has more children on its left subtree than its right subtree.
2. **Right-heavy imbalance**: When a node has more children on its right subtree than its left subtree.

To restore balance in the tree, multiple rotations may be required when:

* The imbalanced node is not at the root of the tree (i.e., it's not a leaf node).
* The rotation would still leave an imbalance if performed only once.

In this case, one or more additional rotations might be necessary to rebalance the tree. This ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, which is crucial for maintaining efficient search and insertion/deletion operations.

"I apologize, but the context provided has no relevance to the query about AVL trees. The context appears to be discussing data replication and consistency models, specifically monotonic read consistency.

As for the query, I can provide an answer based on my knowledge of AVL trees.

In an AVL tree, imbalances refer to deviations from the balanced property, which is that the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most one. There are two types of imbalances:

1. Left-left imbalance (LL): When a node's left child has another left child.
2. Right-right imbalance (RR): When a node's right child has another right child.

To restore balance, multiple rotations may be required in the following scenarios:

* LL-RR: When both the left and right children are imbalanced, requiring two rotations to fix the issue.
* RR-LL: When the root node is imbalanced, requiring one rotation followed by another at a deeper level (potentially recursive).

In general, single rotations can usually restore balance when an AVL tree becomes unbalanced. However, in cases where multiple nodes are involved or the imbalance is more complex, multiple rotations may be necessary to maintain the balanced property.

Please note that this answer assumes the query is related to AVL trees and not data replication or consistency models, which would require a different approach based on the provided context."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"I must say that the context provided is unrelated to the query about AVL trees. The context appears to be discussing optimistic concurrency control in NoSQL databases, specifically how to handle conflicts when multiple transactions are modifying data simultaneously.

The query asks about imbalances in an AVL tree and what kind of imbalances require multiple rotations. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most one.

In an AVL tree, there are two types of imbalances:

1. Left-heavy: When the left subtree of a node has more nodes than its right subtree.
2. Right-heavy: When the right subtree of a node has more nodes than its left subtree.

When either type of imbalance occurs, a rotation is necessary to balance the tree. In an AVL tree, there are two types of rotations:

* Left rotation (LL or LR): Used to balance a left-heavy node.
* Right rotation (RR or RL): Used to balance a right-heavy node.

In general, single rotations can resolve most imbalances in an AVL tree. However, if the imbalance is more severe, multiple rotations may be required. For example:

* If a node has a left-heavy child and that child also has a left-heavy grandchild, a double rotation (LLR or RRR) may be needed to balance the tree.
* Similarly, if a node has a right-heavy child and that child also has a right-heavy grandchild, a double rotation (LRR or LLR) may be required.

To determine whether multiple rotations are necessary, you would need to analyze the specific imbalance in the AVL tree."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
