Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, there are a few parts that mention Redis. Let me go through them one by one.

First, in page 22 of the document, it says that Redis provides 16 databases by default. That's clear. But wait, they don't specify what those names are; just numbers from 0 to 15. So that's a straightforward count there.

Then on page 23, there's a chunk about direct interaction commands and languages. It mentions various models like KV store, graph, spatial, etc., but it doesn't give the specific number of databases Redis supports for these. However, since Redis is primarily known as a KV store by default, maybe that part isn't directly relevant unless there are additional components related to other data structures or models.

Looking at page 24, which seems to discuss Redis' durability featuresâ€”append-only files and snapshots saving. It doesn't mention any number of databases here, just the technical details.

Page 18 talks about Redis being an in-memory database but can handle complex data. That's more about its capabilities than the number of supported databases.

In page 19, there's a discussion on Redis-py, which is the Python client for Redis. It mentions that Redis-py supports various data types and operations, but again, it doesn't directly answer how many databases Redis itself supports beyond the default 16.

So compiling this information, Redis by itself is supported by 16 databases because of the default Redis API. The other sections are about additional features or related technologies like Python bindings or durability mechanisms, which don't add to the count of total databases Redis provides.

Redis provides 16 databases by default. 

Answer: Redis supports a total of 16 databases as per its default implementation."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by looking through the context provided. The user has given a lot of documents discussing Redis and related topics.

From the first chunk, it says Redis is an open-source in-memory database system that supports 16 default databases. They mention ""they are numbered 0 to 15,"" so I can count that as 16. 

I don't see any other mentions of other databases being supported by Redis except for the section about durability and rolling forward if a failure occurs, which doesn't directly relate to the number of databases. The documents also talk about it supporting KV stores and various models like graphs or full text search but again, that's more about its use cases rather than the number of databases.

So, based on this context, Redis primarily supports 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, it seems that Redis is an in-memory database system. Let me go through each relevant section to find any mentions of multiple databases.

Looking at the PDFs and chunks mentioned, especially pages 22 and 18. On page 22, there's a list saying that Redis provides 16 databases by default. Each is numbered from 0 to 15. So that's 16 in total.

Then on page 17, there's another section discussing Redis as a remote directory server and mentions it has many language libraries and vector types like geospatial data. That doesn't refer to multiple databases but rather the number of database instances you can create within Redis.

On pages 23-24, they talk about Redis supporting durability with snapshots on disk at specific intervals or append-only files that allow roll-forward if a failure occurs. They also mention no secondary indexes and only support lookup by key.

The other documents like ""Moving Beyond the Relational Model"" don't seem directly related to Redis's database support count but focus more on distributed systems and replication methods.

So, putting it all together, from page 22, there are exactly 16 databases supported. The other sections either mention different aspects of Redis or relate to other data models but don't provide additional information about the number of databases.
