Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me read through the query again and see what information is provided.

The query is ""How many databases does Redis support?"" and it's followed by a chunk of text that mentions ""16 databases by default."" The text doesn't provide an exact number but states they're numbered 0 to 15, which would make sense because numbering from 0 starts at zero. So if the first database is 0, then there are 16 in total.

Looking back at the context, I see that the query was answered with ""16 databases"" using a number from 0-15 range. That matches what's mentioned here. The other parts of the text talk about direct interaction commands and language libraries but don't add more to the count or clarity on how many they are.

So I think the answer is that Redis supports 16 databases, numbered 0 through 15.

The context states that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. Therefore, Redis supports 16 databases in total."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, let's try to figure this out. The query is asking, ""How many databases does Redis support?"" 

Looking at the context provided, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases, numbered from 0 to 15. There's no other name associated with them, so they are simply referred to as 0 to 15.

So, directly answering the question based on the context, Redis supports 16 databases in total.

The context states that Redis provides 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. The query is asking for that number.

Looking at the context, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So each database is identified by a unique number within that range. 

The context also touches on direct interaction commands and the availability of language libraries but doesn't mention any numbers related to the count of databases. It does mention that there are no other names associated with Redis beyond these numbers, so I don't need to consider anything else.

Therefore, based solely on the information given about the default number of supported databases, Redis supports 16.
