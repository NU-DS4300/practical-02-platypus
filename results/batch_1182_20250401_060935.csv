"Based on the provided context, I can infer that you are interested in information about AVL trees and their properties.

After analyzing the given documents, I found relevant content related to AVL trees on page 13 of ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" (chunk Trees). According to this source, an AVL tree requires multiple rotations when it experiences a certain type of imbalance. Specifically:

* A left-heavy node is when the height of the left subtree is greater than the height of the right subtree plus one.
* A right-heavy node is when the height of the right subtree is greater than the height of the left subtree plus one.

In both cases, multiple rotations are needed to restore balance in the tree."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"Based on the provided context, I found a relevant passage from ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" (page 11, chunk Cyclic vs Acyclic 12) with similarity 0.50.

According to this passage, an AVL tree requires two rotations when there is a ""Left-Right Imbalance"" or ""Right-Left Imbalance"", meaning that the height of the left and right subtrees differs by more than one level. In such cases, a combination of single-left and single-right rotations are needed to rebalance the tree.

In other words, if an AVL tree has multiple imbalances, it will require multiple rotations to restore balance, specifically:

1. Left-Right Imbalance: Single-left rotation + Single-right rotation
2. Right-Left Imbalance: Single-right rotation + Single-left rotation

These imbalances can occur when nodes are inserted or deleted from the tree, causing its height to increase or decrease unevenly.

I hope this answer is accurate and helpful!"|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"Based on the provided context, I don't have direct information about AVL trees or their imbalances. The context appears to be related to graph data models, data replication, and arrays/tuples, but it does not mention AVL trees specifically.

Therefore, I must say ""I don't know"" as there is no relevant information in the given context to answer this query accurately. If you provide more context or clarify the question, I'll do my best to assist you!"|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
