"According to the provided context, the EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) lifecycle consists of four stages:

1. **Launch**: This stage occurs when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: In this stage, you can temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Reboot**: You can restart an instance without affecting data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: This is the final stage where you permanently delete the instance.

These stages represent the various ways to manage and control EC2 instances throughout their lifecycle."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the stages of operation for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance:

1. **Launch**: This is the initial creation of a new EC2 instance with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This stage involves temporarily suspending the use of an EC2 instance without deleting it. The instance remains in a stopped state, and you can restart it later.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deletes the EC2 instance, freeing up resources.
4. **Reboot**: Restarts an EC2 instance without losing data on the root volume.

These four stages (Launch, Start/Stop, Terminate, Reboot) collectively make up the EC2 lifecycle."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"According to the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different states that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can be in:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This is when you temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance. The instance remains available, but it's not using resources.
3. **Terminate**: This is when you permanently delete the instance.
4. **Reboot**: This is when you restart an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These lifecycle states allow you to manage and control your EC2 instances according to your needs."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
