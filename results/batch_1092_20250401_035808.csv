"A graph data model question! While the context is not directly related to AWS or NoSQL databases, I'll do my best to answer your query.

According to the context, we're looking at an AVL tree. In an AVL tree, imbalances occur when the height of one subtree differs from the height of another subtree by more than a certain threshold (usually 1). There are two types of imbalances that require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-Left imbalance**: When a node is inserted or deleted on the left side of a node and its left child also has a left-heavy subtree, leading to an imbalance. In this case, you would need to perform a zig-zig (LL) rotation.
2. **Right-Right imbalance**: Similarly, when a node is inserted or deleted on the right side of a node and its right child also has a right-heavy subtree, causing an imbalance. Here, you would require a ziz-zag (RR) rotation.

In both cases, multiple rotations are needed to restore the AVL tree's balance property, ensuring that the height difference between subtrees remains within the specified threshold.

"A graph data model question!

While I'm familiar with the context provided, it appears that this query is not directly related to graph databases or graph theory. However, I'll do my best to answer based on my understanding of trees and balancing in general.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the tree remains approximately balanced after insertion or deletion operations. Imbalances in an AVL tree can occur when the height of one subtree differs significantly from the other subtree by more than a certain threshold (usually 1).

There are two types of imbalances that require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-left imbalance**: When both left child nodes of a node have their heights greater than its own height, which requires two left rotations to restore balance.
2. **Right-right imbalance**: When both right child nodes of a node have their heights greater than its own height, which also requires two right rotations to restore balance.

In general, AVL tree imbalances are resolved by performing single or double rotations to maintain the self-balancing property. These rotations involve re-arranging the tree's structure to ensure that the height difference between subtrees remains within the threshold.

While this answer may not be directly related to graph databases or Neo4j, I hope it provides a helpful explanation of AVL tree imbalances and the need for multiple rotations!"|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"A graph data model question!

Not directly related to relational databases or NoSQL databases, but I'll do my best to answer based on the context.

According to the AVL tree documentation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree), there are two types of imbalances that can occur in an AVL tree:

1. **Left-Right imbalance**: When a node has two children and one child is taller than the other, it's considered left-right imbalance. To fix this, you need to perform a single rotation (either left or right) to maintain the balance property.
2. **Right-Left imbalance**: When a node has two children and one child is shorter than the other, it's considered right-left imbalance. Similarly, a single rotation (left or right) can correct this imbalance.

However, there are scenarios where multiple rotations are required:

* **Double-right imbalance**: When a node has three grandchildren with heights 2-3-4 (or 1-2-3), you need to perform two consecutive right rotations to rebalance the tree.
* **Double-left imbalance**: Similarly, when a node has three grandchildren with heights 4-3-2 (or 3-2-1), you need to perform two consecutive left rotations.

In both cases, multiple rotations are necessary to restore the balance property of the AVL tree.
