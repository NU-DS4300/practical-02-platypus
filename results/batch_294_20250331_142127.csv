Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.

The context mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system but supports durability features. It says it's essentially saving snapshots to disk at specific intervals and also append-only files which are journalized for roll-forward if something fails. Redis was originally developed in 2009 using C++ and is known for being very fast, handling over 100,000 set operations per second. The context doesn't mention the exact release date but does say it's an in-memory system, which I think means Redis might be a successor to existing databases.

Looking at point 19 in the context, it has a similarity score of 0.44 and mentions that Redis doesn't handle complex data; it only supports lookup by key. However, this part of the text doesn't provide information about when Redis was released, just clarifies its limitations on data complexity.

So, considering all the other points in the context: Redis is mentioned as a successor to traditional databases but not detailed with release dates. The information given doesn't include specific years for Redis's release. Therefore, I don't have enough details from the provided context to determine when Redis was actually released. It seems that this question might be based on incomplete or incorrect data.

The context does not provide specific dates related to Redis's release. It mentions Redis as a successor but doesn't include any information about its actual deployment timeline. Therefore, it's impossible to accurately determine when Redis was released based solely on the provided text.

Answer: Redis was not explicitly mentioned in the context regarding its release date; the information provided is insufficient for this determination."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Redis was released. From the context provided, it says that Redis was originally developed in 2009 in C++ and has been around for a while now. The context also mentions it supports durable data with features like saving snapshots to disk or using journaling for roll-forward functionality. It talks about its speed being up to 100,000 SET operations per second and the rich collection of commands but doesn't go into when it was actually released.

Wait, I'm not sure if Redis was just in development before it was made available as a product or if it had a release date. The context mentions ""originally developed"" but doesn't specify a release date. I remember that some older software projects don't have official release dates because they're still under development, and they only become available to the public after being commercialized or made into a product.

So Redis might have been around in some form before, perhaps as an open-source project or an early implementation. Even though it was developed initially for C++, there might be a specific version that was released by now. I think Redis 1.x was around from around 2008 to 2013, but maybe the actual release came much later. 

I'm trying to recall if I heard any announcements about Redis before it was officially released. There's a mention of ""The Rise of Redis,"" which happened in 2016. That might indicate that Redis was already a product with its own release date before 2017 or so.

So putting this together, even though the context doesn't specify the exact year, I think Redis was released around late 2013 to early 2014, maybe by then it became a commercial product. The fact that the speed is up to 100,000 operations per second suggests that Redis had been in use for some time before being commercialized.

Redis was released in late 2013 or early 2014 as a commercial product. The initial development started around 2008 and the system's performance at handling up to 100,000 SET operations per second indicates its long-standing use before being commercialized.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let's see... The context mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system and supports durability mechanisms. It was originally developed in 2009 but that's before Redis came out as a main driver for in-memory databases. 

The text says it's considered an in-memory database, so maybe I should look into the timeline of Redis development. Redis probably started as part of the RabbitMQ project or something similar. From what I remember, when I was studying data engineering, they mentioned that Redis became widely used after a while because it was good for scenarios where disk space wasn't an issue. 

But wait, how long before Redis was actually released? I think Redis was first released in 2014 as part of the RabbitMQ product line. That makes sense because I remember seeing mentions of RabbitMQ and Redis being on that platform back then. So, putting it all together, Redis was introduced around 2014. 

I should double-check if any other sources mention a different release date for Redis. But based on the information given, the context directly states that it supports durability mechanisms and mentions it as an in-memory database with high performance. The specific year is likely 2014. So, my answer should be 2014.

Redis was released in 2014.
