Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and database terminology.

I remember that when dealing with databases, especially those known for their in-memory storage capabilities, there's a naming convention. Typically, each database within a Redis setup is assigned a number from 0 up to some maximum value. In the provided context, it mentions ""Repos numbered 0 to 15."" That probably means there are 16 databases supported by Redis because it starts at 0.

But wait, I should double-check if this includes all possible options or if some versions might support more than 16. From what I recall, Redis offers various distributions each year with different numbers of available databases. For example, Redis 5.x supports 8 databases, and later versions like Redis 7.0 have more options.

However, the context specifically says ""Repos numbered 0 to 15"" for the current version mentioned (page 22). That would indicate that Redis 6.x has 16 supported databases because it starts at 0 and ends at 15, which is a total of 16. But I should confirm if any later versions extend this range.

Looking back, in the context provided, it's about Redis 6.x with 16 databases. If there were a version where numbers go up to, say, 20 or more, that would mean Redis 7.x and beyond support higher numbers of databases. But based on the given information, Redis 6.x supports 16 databases.

So, putting it all together, I can conclude that Redis 6.x supports 16 databases by default.

Based on the provided context, Redis 6.x supports 16 databases because the repos are numbered from 0 to 15.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the context mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. It also says they are numbered from 0 to 15. That part is pretty clearâ€” Redis has 16 available when you start using it.

Then, there's a mention of ""Similarity 0.17."" I'm not entirely sure what that refers to, but maybe it's a score or version number. Since the main focus is on the number of databases Redis supports, I don't think I need to go into details about the similarity metric unless the query specifically asks for something else.

The answer provided earlier states that there are 16 databases in total. But wait, let me double-check if that's accurate. From what I recall, Redis supports a wide range of database engines like MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others, but each version typically supports only one specific database. For example, Redis 5.x might support different combinations based on the engine.

However, in the context given, it specifically mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So I think the answer they're referring to is indeed 16, not considering any other versions or additional engines beyond the standard set provided by Redis themselves.

Wait a second, sometimes users might have their own plugins or third-party libraries that extend Redis' functionality, but those are considered different ""databases"" in the context of Redis. So if someone uses these, they would count as separate databases from the default ones.

But based on the query asked, which is about how many databases Redis supports in its default configuration, it should be 16.
</think>

The query asks: ""How many databases does Redis support?""

Based on the context provided:

- Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15.

Therefore, Redis supports **16 databases**."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me read through that again.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It also talks about direct interaction with Redis using commands related to k/v pairs and variations. Then it refers to language libraries available as well. The last number mentioned is 23, but I'm not sure where that fits in.

Wait, maybe the context is referring to something else. It's structured like a PDF page, so perhaps there are more details on the side. On line 23, it says ""Many language libraries available as well."" But that's just an additional point about languages or other components related to Redis. There's no mention of any databases beyond the numbered ones from 0 to 15.

I should also check if I'm misinterpreting the context. The query is asking for the number of databases Redis supports, so I need to focus on that specific part. It seems clear that Redis defaults to 16 databases. There's no indication in the provided text about any extra or additional libraries beyond the numbered ones.

So, putting it together, Redis supports exactly 16 default databases. The other numbers mentioned, like 23, might be unrelated here. Unless there's a typo or error, I can't add anything else. Therefore, the answer should simply state that Redis supports 16 databases.

Redis supports 16 default databases as specified in the context provided.
