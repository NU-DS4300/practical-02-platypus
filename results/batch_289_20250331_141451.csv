Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. It doesn't say anything about variations or other names beyond these numbers. So, it's clear that there are 16 distinct databases by default provided by Redis. 

I don't see any part of the text mentioning extra libraries or languages besides the main ones. The number is explicitly stated as 16. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that Redis supports 16 databases.

The context indicates that Redis provides 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15, with no mention of variations or additional libraries beyond these numbers.

The context says that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So that's straightforward. The answer is 16, and the query mentions similarity which might be a different measure, but probably not relevant here.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to answer the query about how many databases Redis supports. 

First, I remember that from the context given, it's talking about a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf."" Looking at page 22, there are some lines that mention Redis Database and Interaction. It says Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So that makes me think Redis supports 16 databases.

Wait, but the context also mentions ""Many language libraries available as well,"" which might be more about how it can work with other languages. The main point is about the number of Redis databases. 

I should make sure I'm not mixing up any numbers here. It's important to get this right because if someone uses Redis, they know their system has 16 database instances. So I'll go with 16 as the answer.
