"According to the context, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

* Strings
* Lists (linked lists)
* Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
* Sorted Sets
* Hashes (string → string)

These data types allow for a variety of use cases and operations, making Redis a versatile NoSQL database."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"A query about my favorite topic - Redis!

According to the provided context, Redis supports the following data types for values:

1. **Strings**: A sequence of characters that can be used as a value in a key-value pair.
2. **Lists (linked lists)**: An ordered collection of strings or binary sequences.
3. **Sets (unique unsorted string elements)**: An unordered set of unique strings or binary sequences.
4. **Sorted Sets**: A set of strings or binary sequences sorted by a score or value.
5. **Hashes (string → string)**: A mapping from a string key to a string value.

These data types can be used in Redis as values, which are stored along with the corresponding keys."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
