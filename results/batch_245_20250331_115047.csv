Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to this query. The user is asking about the data types supported by Redis for values. Looking at the context provided, it's a PDF document discussing Redis as an in-memory database system. 

The relevant section mentions that Redis supports various data types for values. Specifically, it lists Redis DB with details like being open source, in-memory, KV store, primary model of storage, and some specific commands. It also gives an example of 16 databases numbered from 0 to 15.

So, the query is asking me to name these data types supported by Redis for values. The context mentions that Redis supports a variety of binary sequences as values, including strings, lists (linked lists), sets (unique unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes (string to string transformations), and geospatial data with similarity.

I need to make sure I list all these correctly without adding anything else unless necessary. The example provided in the document includes things like ""set"" which is a key-value storage. Since the query specifically asks for values, not the primary storage model, it should include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data.

I should structure the answer clearly, perhaps starting with Redis as an open-source database system, then listing each supported data type in order. That way, the user can easily understand which types are available for values.

Redis supports various binary sequences as values, including strings, lists (linked lists), sets (unique unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes (string â†’ string transformations), and geospatial data with similarity 0.31.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many data types Redis supports. Looking at the context provided, I see a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" which has several sections discussing Redis. 

In one section (page 19), it mentions ""Redis Data Types Keys"": - usually strings but can be any binary sequence. So that's two data types: keys and values for the keys.

Then on page 22, it talks about Redis Database and Interaction. It says there are 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. Each database has its own name and purpose. This suggests 16 distinct names here, each associated with their own name and function.

I'm trying to remember if the context mentions anything else related to data types. On page 23, it lists Redis Database and Interaction, but that's about the number of databases. It doesn't specifically mention data types or commands. 

Additionally, on pages 17-19, it's talking about Redis as a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc., which are more complex. But that's about use cases, not data types.

On page 24, it lists the ranking of KV stores, mentioning Redis first after PostgreSQL and MySQL in terms of performance.

Redis supports two primary data types: keys (strings or binary sequences) and values. It also provides a suite of 16 databases by default, each with their own unique name and purpose.

Okay, so I need to figure out what Redis supports as value types. I've looked at some of the context provided and there's a lot about how Redis works. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I see sections about Redis DB, but that seems more like a database storage section rather than value types. The main query is about data types for values. So I should focus on parts where data types are discussed in relation to storage or commands.

Looking at the context, there's a part that talks about Redis being an in-memory database system with durability features. It mentions things like snapshots and journaling which relate to data persistence. But that doesn't directly talk about value types as far as I can tell.

Then, there's a section discussing Redis as a Python client. It says Redis-py is the standard client for Python and maintains by Redis themselves. They also mention GitHub repo and an Environment file setup. So that part might be relevant if someone is using Redis in Python, but I'm not sure how it directly addresses value types.

I notice there are chunks about Redis data types and keys. Specifically, they list values as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, etc., but those seem to describe what the storage can store, not the types of values within a key or entry. 

In another part, there's a mention of ""Rich collection of commands,"" which might imply that Redis supports many different operations, each expecting specific data types. But again, it doesn't specify what those types are.

I also see a reference to Redis being used with Python, but not directly about the value types in Redis. The section on ""Database and Interaction"" talks about direct interaction commands, but that's more about how you access data rather than the types of values stored there.

So putting it all together, I think Redis supports various types for its values, including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, etc., as described in some parts. But without specific section titles mentioning value types, I can't be certain which ones they're referring to.

I should probably look up Redis documentation or resources to confirm the exact value types it supports, but based on what's provided here, I'm fairly confident that the primary types are strings, lists, sets, etc., as outlined.
</think>

The Redis data type supported primarily for values includes:

- Strings
- Lists (which are sequences of elements)
- Sets (which are unordered collections of unique elements)
- Sorted Sets (which maintain order and allow duplicates)
- Hashes (which map keys to values, typically strings)

These types cover the fundamental storage requirements for Redis."|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
