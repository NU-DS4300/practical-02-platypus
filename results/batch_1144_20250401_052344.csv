Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. The query is ""When was Redis released?"" and the context provided mentions that it's page 12 of a document called Redis in Context 13 with a similarity score of 0.28. 

First, I'll look at the specific part of the context. It says, ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12, chunk Redis in Context 13) with similarity 0.28."" The key points here are that it's a document about using Redis with Python and page 12 is related to Redis within that context.

Since the query specifically asks for when Redis was released, I need to find information on its release date. However, in the provided text, there isn't any mention of the release year or time period. The context only talks about a document file name and mentions Redis as part of a chunk, but no details on release info are given.

Therefore, based on the context provided, I don't have enough information to determine when Redis was released. The answer would be that the specific information isn't available in the given context.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me see what information is there.

The context provided is from a document named ""Redis + Python.pdf."" The specific part mentioned is page 12 in context 13. It says, ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12, chunk Redis in Context 13) with similarity 0.28"" and then there's an answer about Redis being released on March 15, 2014.

Wait a minute, I'm trying to recall when Redis was actually released. I think Redis started around 2011 or so. Maybe in late 2013? Oh, the context says it's March 15, 2014. That seems too recent compared to my existing memory.

I should check if there's any other information in the context that might clarify this. The query is specifically asking for Redis release date, and the answer provided by the system is March 15, 2014. But I'm not sure if that's accurate because I think it was a bit later back then.

I wonder if there was any more recent information about Redis after this document? Maybe from other sources or discussions on forums. But based solely on the context provided here, which mentions Redis in Context 13 and is part of the same document, the answer given seems to be March 2014.

So, even though I thought it might have been a bit later, the answer from the system is March 15, 2014. Maybe there was some confusion or the data had changed since then.

The Redis document mentions that Redis was released on March 15, 2014. However, according to my current knowledge, Redis was actually released in late 2013. It's possible that the context has an outdated date provided by the source."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out when Redis was released based on the context provided. The query is ""When was Redis released?"" and the context mentions a document called ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf"" on page 14, chunk Redis in DS/ML 15. It also refers to a source atmadewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/, which I think is about feature stores using ML. Additionally, it includes information about the similarity of Redis in DS/ML as 183.81.

I'm not entirely sure how ""DS"" stands for anything here. Maybe it's a specific area within data science or machine learning? The term ""source"" suggests that this is an online resource from madewithml.com, which uses Python and feature stores for machine learning. They mention using Redis in the context of feature stores.

Looking at the query again: ""When was Redis released?"" I know Redis was originally developed by Cloudflare as a network abstraction protocol for inter-node communication. It's known to be very fast and has good memory efficiency. However, it doesn't have a specific release date like programming languages do; instead, its features are widely used across different platforms.

The context here is about Redis in the ML context within DS/ML, so maybe they're referring to the version or specific implementation of Redis that's being used for machine learning tasks. But without more details, I can't determine when a particular version was released. Maybe madewithml.com has specific versions and releases mentioned there?

Additionally, the mention of ""183.81"" in terms of similarity might be an identifier or metric related to Redis in that context. Without knowing what that number represents, it's hard to connect it to a release date.

So, given all this, I don't have enough information about when Redis was released based on the provided context because Redis isn't released by anyone; its features are used across various platforms and versions. The context is more about using Redis in an ML framework called feature stores.
</think>

The query ""When was Redis released?"" seeks to determine the release date of Redis, a programming language known for its efficient network abstraction protocol (NOP). However, Redis isn't released by any individual; instead, it's widely used across different platforms and versions. The context provided discusses Redis in an ML framework called feature stores, which suggests it's being used as part of this system.

The document referenced mentions page 14 from ""MadewithML,"" a resource for machine learning, but it doesn't specify any release dates or versions. Without additional details about specific Redis versions or their use cases within feature stores, the context doesn't provide a definitive answer. The mention of terms like ""DS/ML"" and the source might indicate that Redis is being used in this particular ML framework context but doesn't yield release information.

In summary, while madewithml.com discusses Redis in an ML context, there's no concrete information to determine Redis's release date as it isn't released by any individual or organization."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
