Okay, I need to figure out how many data types Redis supports for its values and what each of them is. From the context provided, it seems like the user has given some information about Redis as a database and some documentation links. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the section on ""Redis Data Types Keys"" on page 19, it mentions that the keys are typically strings. The values can be various types. It lists several: Strings, Lists (which are linked lists), Sets (which store unique elements without order), Sorted Sets (which maintain insertion order), Hashes which map keys to values, and Geospatial data with a similarity of 0.17.

Next, in the ""Redis Database"" section on page 22, it explains that Redis supports 16 default databases by number from 0 to 15. There's also mention of direct commands for interacting with k/v pairs and highlights some key points. These details don't directly address the data types, so I can skip them.

Looking at the documentation links provided (like page 3 on Redis Command List), it lists a full list of Redis commands, but those are more about how to perform operations rather than what data types are supported for values.

Additionally, in another part (page 18), it states that Redis is an in-memory system with durability: either saving snapshots or being append-only. It also mentions its speed, up to 100,000 set operations per second and its lack of secondary indexes for complex data, which doesn't directly answer the question about data types.

So, putting this together, from the context given, Redis supports strings as keys and multiple types of values: Strings, Lists, Sets (sorted or not), Hashes, and Geospatial data. The documentation mentions these but doesn't list them all numerically.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for its values include:

1. **Strings**: The primary data type used for keys and value storage.
2. **Lists**: A linked list that can be ordered or unordered, supporting a variable number of elements.
3. **Sets**: Store unique elements without maintaining order, with the option to be sorted or not.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain insertion order.
5. **Hashes**: Map keys to values using key-value pairs.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Supports geospatial data with similarity specified as 0.17.

These types are used for storing and managing data efficiently, particularly in an in-memory environment."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values based on the provided context. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, in the NoSQL Introduction section from page 19, it mentions that Redis typically acts as a KV store but can be used with other models like graphs and sets. It talks about values being strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. So that gives me some of the primary types: strings, lists, sets, etc.

Next, looking at Redis databases from page 22, it says Redis provides 16 default databases. The context doesn't specify what each database supports, so I canâ€™t add more from there right now. It does mention durability aspects and supports in-memory operations but also has complex data handling beyond just simple values.

In the Python section (page 3), Redis Command List mentions that Redis uses command-based approach for commands related to KV pairs or other structures like sets. So, it doesn't directly list data types but provides tools for interacting with these structures.

The NoSQL Introduction page includes a bullet point about Redis being an in-memory database and supporting durability through snapshots or append-only files. That reinforces that it handles simple values well, possibly using key-value pairs efficiently.

Putting this together, the primary values Redis supports include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are functions returning strings), and geospatial data. I don't see any mention of other data types like dates or booleans in these sections, so those might not be supported here.
</think>

The primary data types Redis supports for values based on the provided context include:

1. **Strings**: The most common type used extensively.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: A collection of items.
3. **Sets**: Unordered collections without duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Order matters, though unique elements are stored.
5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Key-value pairs where keys and values are strings.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Types that represent geographic information, such as coordinates or points on a map.

These data types are fundamental to Redis's in-memory operations, providing efficient key-value storage and handling of various data structures needed for different use cases."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out which data types Redis supports for holding values. From the context provided, I see several documents and slides that talk about Redis. Let me go through them one by one.

First, on page 19 of the document ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" it mentions several key points: Redis is an in-memory database used as a KV store sometimes called a data structure store. It supports various types like lists, sets, hashes, etc., and also geospatial data with similarity numbers.

Looking at page 17 of the same document, it breaks down Redis into different models such as graph, spatial, full text search, vector, time series, etc. Each has specific requirements, like being a KV store or having certain features.

Then on page 22, there's a section about Direct Interaction with Redis, mentioning that they have 16 default databases and support commands for handling K/V pairs. It also talks about durability of data, supporting snapshots to disk at intervals or append-only files, which can be roll-forward if something fails. Redis was developed in C++ originally but is now used as a Python library.

On page 3 of the same document's Redis Command List, it provides a list of commands for different structures like list, hash, set, etc., and notes that it's not exhaustive. The documentation can be found on page 4.

From page 18, Redis mentions durability with snapshots or an append-only file, but doesn't go into detail. It does say it's very fast and supports 100,000 SET operations per second, which is good for in-memory use.

Looking at page 5 of the document, there are bullet points listing different data structures Redis can hold. Each structure requires a specific key type. For example:

- List: String
- Set: Unique Strings (no duplicates)
- Map: Hashes (String to String or other types)
- Time Series: Numbers with timestamps

Additionally, it mentions that Redis doesn't handle complex data like objects unless they're encapsulated into lists and have keys. So the most basic operations are supported.

Putting this all together, I can list the key value pairs that Redis supports:
- Strings
- Lists (with unique elements)
- Sets (no duplicates)
- Maps (hashes)
- Time series (numbers with timestamps)

I also know that Redis doesn't support complex data structures like objects without encapsulation. So for simple lookups and operations, these types are supported.
</think>

Repos can hold various key-value pairs using Redis based on the data structure they represent:

1. **String**: Directly holds strings for basic values.
2. **List**: Supports sets with unique elements (no duplicates).
3. **Set**: Provides unordered lists without duplicates.
4. **Map**: Uses hashes, which can include numbers, strings, or other keys, and handle nested structures by encapsulating them in lists.
5. **Time Series**: Stores numbers along with timestamps.

These basic operations allow Redis to manage data efficiently within its memory system."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
