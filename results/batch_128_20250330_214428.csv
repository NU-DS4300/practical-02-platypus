Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause it to require multiple rotations. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best.

First, I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree. It's kept balanced using two main properties: the heights of the left and right subtrees can differ by at most one. If they do, the tree is unbalanced, which can lead to inefficiencies like frequent node moves or worse performance.

I think imbalances in an AVL tree occur when there are sudden changes in the number of nodes, especially if the order isn't maintained properly after a deletion or insertion. For example, if I remove a node that wasn't directly below the root and it messes up the balance, the left subtree could become taller than the right, or vice versa.

So, let's break this down. When an imbalance happens, like when the height difference exceeds one, the tree isn't properly balanced anymore. This is where rotations come into play. Rotations help restore the balance by moving nodes around to maintain the AVL property.

I remember there are two types of imbalances: left-heavy and right-heavy. In a left-heavy imbalance, the right subtree is taller than the left. To fix this, I think we need to perform a rotation on the root node. This usually involves either moving the right child from its current position or adjusting the tree's structure.

Wait, when you have an imbalance that causes the right subtree to be taller, do you always rotate the root? Or does it depend on which side is more affected? I think in some cases, you might need multiple rotations if after one rotation the tree isn't balanced anymore. So maybe there are specific scenarios where two or even three rotations are required.

I also recall that a ""perfect"" AVL tree has no imbalances at all because every node perfectly balances its children. But any imbalance means the tree is unbalanced. To handle this, we use rotations to restore balance.

So putting it together, when an AVL tree has an imbalance caused by removing a node or changing data in a way that disrupts balance, multiple rotations are needed. It depends on whether the left or right subtree needs adjustment and how many steps are required to rebalance.

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur during sudden structural changes, such as removing a non-adjacent node, which can cause imbalance. These imbalances lead to situations where the heights of the subtrees differ by more than one. To restore balance, specific rotations are performed:

1. **Left Heavy Imbalance**: When the right subtree is taller than the left after an imbalance.
   - **Rotation**: Rotate around the root node (right child) to rebalance.

2. **Right Heavy Imbalance**: When the left subtree becomes too deep after an imbalance.
   - **Rotation**: Rotate around the root node (left child) or use a different method like the ""splay"" rotation, which involves moving nodes closer to the root more efficiently.

3. **Multiple Rotations Needed**: In some cases, one rotation isn't sufficient. For example, if multiple imbalances occur sequentially, two rotations might be necessary to restore balance after each imbalance.

In summary, multiple rotations are needed when an AVL tree's structure becomes unstable during insertions or deletions, requiring adjustments through specific rotations to maintain balance and performance."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what an AVL tree is. It's a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This helps keep operations like insertion and deletion efficient because they maintain logarithmic time complexity.

I know that for AVL trees, after inserting or deleting a node, we might need to rebalance the tree. The main issue arises when the balance condition isn't met, causing an imbalance. Now, how do multiple rotations come into play here?

From what I've read before, when an insertion causes the left subtree of a node to be taller than its right subtree by more than one level (or vice versa), we perform two rotations: first the left rotation and then the right or vice versa.

Let me think about this step by step. Suppose during an insertion, after adding a new node, the height difference increases beyond 1. We need to fix it by moving nodes from the higher subtree down to the lower one. If there are too many nodes in the higher subtree that need to be moved up, we perform a left rotation on the parent of the unbalanced node. After that, if the balance condition is still violated, we perform a right rotation on the new parent.

So, each imbalance leads to two rotations: first the smaller one (left or right) and then the larger one, depending on the situation. This ensures that after rebalancing, the tree maintains its AVL property without causing further imbalances unless necessary.

I also remember that in some cases, like when multiple nodes need moving, we have to do both rotations sequentially. For example, if two consecutive insertions cause more imbalance each time, it might require both a left and then a right rotation or vice versa.

Let me try an example: inserting into the root causes its right subtree to become taller by two levels. So, I would first perform a right rotation on the root (or perhaps another node depending on which side is unbalanced). After that insertion, maybe the tree is still unbalanced, so I then do a left rotation on the new parent.

This makes me confident that multiple imbalances require two rotations each time. It's not like it's one rotation per imbalance; instead, each imbalance scenario necessitates at least two rotations to fix.
</think>

In an AVL tree, multiple imbalances require two rotations when attempting to maintain balance after insertion or deletion operations. The process involves identifying the unbalanced subtree and performing a sequence of rotations to rebalance the tree.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Imbalance:** When inserting or deleting, check if the tree's height difference between child subtrees exceeds one.
2. **First Rotation:** If the imbalance is on the left side, perform a right rotation on the root node (or another relevant node). This moves nodes from the lower to higher subtree upwards.
3. **Adjust for Balance:** After the first rotation, if the balance condition is still violated, perform a second rotation—typically on the new parent of the unbalanced node—to ensure both subtrees are balanced.
4. **Resulting Tree:** The tree remains AVL after these two rotations, maintaining logarithmic insertion time complexity.

**Conclusion:**
Each imbalance necessitates two rotations to correct, as one may be insufficient for balancing without causing further issues. This ensures the AVL tree maintains its balance property efficiently and performs operations in O(log n) time."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause it to require multiple rotations. Hmm, AVL trees are balanced binary search trees that maintain heights either within one node difference or by enforcing strict left and right subtrees with equal depths. They're used for maintaining balance and ensuring efficient operations.

First, I remember that when a BST isn't balanced, like in an unbalanced case, the tree can become skewed, leading to O(n) time complexity for operations because the tree height becomes too large. AVL trees aim to prevent this by keeping the heights of left and right subtrees as equal as possible.

So, what happens if there's an imbalance? Let me think step by step. When a node is inserted or deleted, it can cause the tree to become unbalanced either on the left or right side. That would result in one subtree being deeper than the other by more than one level. For example, suppose the left subtree is two levels deeper than the root, which is too much for an AVL tree.

In such cases, I think a rotation is needed. Rotations involve moving nodes from one part of the tree to another to restore balance. So, in this scenario, we'd need more than just one rotation—probably two rotations because after rotating once, there might still be imbalances on the same side.

Wait, let me test that. If I have a left subtree deeper by two levels, maybe I first perform an insertion or deletion on the right side to balance it. Then, perhaps another step is needed to fix the new imbalance. That makes sense because after one rotation, there might still be a deeper subtree, so I need another rotation to correct that.

Alternatively, if inserting into a node causes both left and right subtrees to exceed by two levels, maybe each requires a separate rotation. But even then, multiple rotations are needed beyond just one.

Another thought: in the case of a delete operation where the node to be deleted is in the left subtree with its left child higher than the root, I think we might need more than one rotation because after moving nodes around to balance, there could still be another level difference. So, two rotations seem necessary here.

So, putting it all together: when an AVL tree's unbalanced by more than one node difference and requires multiple levels of imbalance, multiple rotations are needed. Specifically, two rotations should suffice in most cases where a single rotation isn't enough to fix the balance after the first attempt.
</think>

When an AVL tree encounters an imbalances caused by a root with nodes differing by more than one level on either side, it necessitates multiple rotations to restore balance. Specifically:

- **Two Rotations**: This is typically needed when the unbalanced situation requires balancing both left and right subtrees after the first rotation.
  
**Answer:** Two rotations are required when an AVL tree has an imbalance that cannot be fixed with a single rotation but needs two rotations after the initial correction.
