Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me read through it carefully.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default and they're numbered from 0 to 15. So, that's straightforward. It also talks about direct interaction commands related to k/v pairs and language libraries available. The sentence at line 23 with the similarity of 0.16 probably refers to the chunk number or something else, but it doesn't seem relevant to the count.

Since the context clearly states there are 16 databases numbered 0 through 15, I can confidently say that Redis supports 16 databases.

The context indicates that Redis provides 16 databases by default.

Okay, let's see what the user is asking here. They provided a query about how many databases Redis supports and I need to answer it. The context they gave mentions that Redis by default provides 16 databases numbered from 0 to 15. So, I should directly state that Redis supports 16 databases.

I also checked if there's any other relevant information in the context. It doesn't seem like there are any additional details about how many databases or their specific names beyond the number and range given. The query is straightforward, so no need to look further. 

Therefore, my answer should be clear and concise: ""Redis supports 16 databases."" I don't think the context provides more information on this particular question.
