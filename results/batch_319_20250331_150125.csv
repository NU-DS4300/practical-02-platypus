Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, I see a PDF section on Redis called ""Redis Database and Interaction."" It mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. That's straightforward. 

But wait, is that all? The query is asking about the total number of databases Redis supports. So maybe it's not just the default ones but all possible ones. Let me check other parts of the context.

Looking through the PDFs and sections, I find another document titled ""NoSQL Intro"" on page 22. It says there are 16 databases by default. That still points to Redis having 16. But then there's a section about Redis DB in another PDF on page 17, which confirms that Redis supports various database types like KV store and others, but it doesn't mention how many it actually has.

I don't see any explicit information in the context about the total number of databases Redis supports beyond the default ones. So maybe the answer is simply 16? Or could there be more details elsewhere?

Wait, perhaps the PDF on page 23 mentions something about durability. It talks about snapshots and journaling but doesn't add numbers. Similarly, other sections don't provide info on how many databases Redis supports beyond the default list.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the context, it seems that Redis supports 16 default databases. If there's no further detail to suggest otherwise, I should answer that Redis provides 16 databases by default.

Based on the provided context, Redis supports 16 default databases by default. This is clearly stated in the PDF section titled ""Redis Database and Interaction,"" where it mentions ""16 databases by default.""

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through each point step by step.

First, looking at the context from the PDFs, there's a section about Redis providing 16 default databases. It mentions they are numbered 0 to 15, and since it says ""They are numbered 0 to 15,"" that immediately gives me a count of 16 databases.

Another point talks about Redis supporting various models like KV store, Graph, Spatial, etc., but doesn't mention the number of supported databases beyond the default ones. So I can ignore that information for this specific question.

There's also a section about the Redis DB rank from another document, which lists the top KV stores according to their ranking. However, this isn't related to counting how many Redis databases exist; it just explains that Redis supports multiple database types, not a fixed number of them.

Looking further into the context with Docker deployment details, the example shows setting up Redis using redis.Redis with parameters like host, port, db, and decoding with True. This information is about the setup but doesn't address how many databases Redis supports in total.

Additionally, there's an example code where it uses Redis with Python, specifically importing Redis via redis.Redis. The context mentions that Redis-py is maintained by the Redis Company themselves and provides a certain number of supported databases when using Docker containers. However, again, this information doesn't add to the count but relates to how Redis is integrated into Python development.

Putting it all together, the main point from the first PDF section clearly states that Redis supports 16 default databases, numbered from 0 to 15. The other sections either discuss the types of data Redis can store or its integration in specific contexts but don't provide additional numbers related to the total supported databases.

Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 16 databases.

Redis supports a total of 16 default databases, numbered from 0 to 15. These are the primary storage units provided by Redis for data management and processing. The context includes details about Redis's support for various database models but does not change this count regarding the number of databases it directly manages.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by looking at the context provided. 

First, from the first paragraph on page 22 of the NoSQL Introduction document, it says that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. They're numbered from 0 to 15. It mentions that there's no other name associated with these 16 databases because each has a unique identifier based on their number.

Then, in another paragraph on page 23 of the same document, it further explains that Redis is an in-memory database system, but they also mention durability features. It talks about snapshots being saved at specific intervals and append-only files which can be rolled forward if there's a failure. However, this doesn't change the number of databases Redis supports.

Moving on to the NoSQL DB section, it says that Redis is primarily a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, or Time Series. But again, the number 16 remains the same because that's the default set they are considering for connection purposes.

Looking at the Redis DB page on the db-engines.com website, it ranks Redis among other KV stores and mentions its in-memory nature. It doesn't provide information about additional databases beyond the 16 numbered ones.

In the Python section from the document, it talks about using Redis with Python by importing the redis module. The connection details include specifying the host, port, database number, and decoding responses to strings. This shows that Redis is used as a client within the Python environment but doesn't change the fact that there are 16 default databases.

The Conda Environment section mentions installing Redis-py using pip. Again, this is about how to access Redis within a Python environment but not affecting the number of supported databases.

Putting all this together, it seems clear that Redis supports 16 databases by default because that's what the context explicitly states in the first paragraph on page 22.

Redis supports 16 default databases. These are numbered from 0 to 15 and provide an in-memory KV store. They can be used with other models but do not add more than these 16. Therefore, Redis supports a total of 16 databases."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
