Alright, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, looking at the section about Redis and its database types in the NoSQL document (page 22), it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So, that's a clear starting point.

Next, I see another section discussing Redis as an open-source in-memory database, ranking KV stores at number 18. This reinforces the idea that Redis supports 16 databases because it's explicitly stated there.

The subsequent text on Redis Data Types covers different types of data storage but doesn't mention the count of supported databases. It mentions strings, lists, sets, etc., which are related to database types but not the number of databases Redis supports in total.

Finally, the Python section about Redis-py being the standard client for Python is just additional information on how Redis can be used in programming, again not directly relevant to the count of supported databases.

So, putting it all together, from the first part where it states 16 databases are default-supported by Redis, that's the key number needed for the query. The other sections don't add any new data beyond confirming that Redis has 16 database engines.

Redis supports 16 default database engines.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each section one by one.

Starting from page 22 of the first document, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default and they are numbered from 0 to 15. There's no other name associated with them. So that's 16 databases right there.

Looking at the next chunk on page 17, which talks about Redis DBs, it says Redis is an open-source in-memory database. It can be used for various models like KV store, graphs, etc., but it primarily supports a KV store model. However, this doesn't affect how many databases Redis itself offers; it's just information on its capabilities.

The other chunks discuss Redis Data Types and Commands List, Redis Command List documentation, Distributed Data Stores, Moving Beyond the Relational Model, and some specific tasks like setting up Redis in Docker and connecting from DataGrip. They don't mention anything about the number of databases Redis supports beyond the 16 mentioned earlier.

So, putting it all together, Redis primarily supports 16 databases by default.

The provided context mentions that Redis offers 16 databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15 and are not extended or added in subsequent sections. Therefore, Redis supports a total of 16 databases.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant section step by step.

First, looking at the NoSQL Intro document from page 22, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That's a clear number there. 

Then, in another section on page 17, it talks about Redis DB and its classification as a KV store, but doesn't specify the exact number of supported databases. The section just mentions that Redis is an open-source in-memory database with many language libraries and ranking. It also discusses durability aspects like snapshots or append-only files.

In another document from page 18, it states that Redis supports durability options: saving data to disk at specific intervals or using a journal for roll-forward. This information comes after the total number of databases supported is mentioned. So that still reinforces that Redis has 16 databases.

The other sections on Python and DataGrip don't provide any information about the number of databases Redis supports, so I can ignore those.

Putting it all together, Redis supports a total of 16 databases.
</think>

Relevant context mentions:

- From page 22: Redis provides 16 databases by default.
- From pages 17 and 18: Redis supports durability features but doesn't specify the number of supported databases.

Answer:
Relevant information shows Redis supports 16 databases. The other sections donâ€™t add to this count.
