"I apologize, but the context provided does not seem to be relevant to the query about AVL trees and their rotations. The queries appear to be related to relational databases, NoSQL databases, and data replication, which are topics outside the scope of AVL trees.

To answer the query accurately, I would need more context or information about AVL trees and their rotation mechanisms. However, based on my understanding of computer science concepts, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that requires two types of rotations: Left-Left (LL) and Right-Right (RR) to maintain its balance property.

To answer the original query accurately, I would need more context or information about the specific imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations.

"A question that's not directly related to the provided context, but I'll do my best to answer it anyway!

In an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree data structure, there are two types of imbalances that can occur:

1. **Left-heavy node**: When a node has more than one level of left children (i.e., its right child's height is less than the left child's height).
2. **Right-heavy node**: When a node has more than one level of right children (i.e., its left child's height is less than the right child's height).

In both cases, multiple rotations are required to restore the balance property of the AVL tree. These imbalances can occur when nodes are inserted or deleted, causing the tree to become unbalanced.

To address these imbalances, an AVL tree uses two types of rotations:

1. **Left rotation**: Rotates a node to the left to rebalance the tree.
2. **Right rotation**: Rotates a node to the right to rebalance the tree.

When multiple rotations are required, the algorithm performs a sequence of rotations until the tree is balanced again. This process ensures that the AVL tree remains self-balancing and efficient for search operations.

"A question that's not directly related to the provided context, but I'll do my best to answer based on my knowledge!

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure. In an AVL tree, rotations are used to maintain balance when insertions or deletions occur.

According to the AVL tree algorithm, the following imbalances require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-left imbalance**: When a node has two left children, it's considered an imbalance. To fix this, a right rotation is performed.
2. **Right-right imbalance**: When a node has two right children, it's also considered an imbalance. To fix this, a left rotation is performed.
3. **Left-right imbalance**: When a node has one left child and one right child, but the left child is taller than the right child (i.e., the left subtree is heavier), it's an imbalance. In this case, a double rotation (left-left or right-right) is required.

In each of these cases, multiple rotations are needed to restore balance to the AVL tree."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
