Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.

The context says that Redis provides 16 databases by default and they are numbered from 0 to 15. So, right away, it seems like Redis supports 16 different databases. The part about Direct interaction with Redis being through commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs and variations is interesting because it doesn't directly answer the number of databases, but it does mention that they are numbered from 0 to 15.

The other section about language libraries available as well isn't relevant here, so I can ignore that. The query is specifically asking for the number of supported databases, which is clearly stated in the context as 16.

I should make sure there's no other information or detail in the context that might suggest a different number. It doesn't mention any exceptions, different configurations, or any other features related to the database count. So, based on what's provided, Redis supports exactly 16 databases.

Redis provides 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me read through the query and the provided context carefully.

The query is asking for ""How many databases does Redis support?"" and the answer provided is 16. The context mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So I think that's where the number comes from.

Looking at the context again, it says, ""Direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs (and variations) - Many language libraries available as well."" But the main point is about the default number of databases Redis supports. That part clearly states there are 16.

So, putting that together, the answer should be 16.

The context explicitly mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases. Therefore, Redis supports **16** databases by default.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. The query is about that, and the context mentions something about Redis providing a certain number of databases by default.

Looking at the text, it says, ""Redis provides 16 databases by default - They are numbered 0 to 15 - There is no other name associated - Direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs (and variations) - Many language libraries available as well."" 

So, the key information here is that there are 16 databases. They're numbered from 0 to 15, which I think means they start at zero. So if it's numbered 0 to 15, that would be 16 different databases in total.

I don't see any other details that suggest Redis supports more than these 16. The context also mentions the languages available and direct commands related to k/v pairs, but those are probably not relevant for this specific question about the number of databases.

Therefore, based on the given text, the answer should be 16.
