Okay, so I need to figure out how many different data types Redis supports for storing values and explain each one based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

First, in the 05 document, it mentions that Redis Data Types has several kinds. It lists strings as a common type, but also notes that they can be any binary sequence. So, I think strings are definitely a supported data type for values.

Next, on page 19 of the 06 document about Redis + Python, there's an example where a dictionary is used with keys and values. But looking further down, the commands shown include mset(), mget(), set(), incr(), and get(). These functions are used to create sets or modify existing ones. Sets are mentioned as unique unsorted string elements, which means each element can only appear once in a set.

Then, page 14 talks about Redis in Context 13 and mentions that Redis is often used with ML/DS (machine learning/data science) context. The example given uses feature stores to store features and their values. Feature stores use objects as keys and values, so objects are another supported data type.

Additionally, the last document link references madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/, which reinforces that objects can be used for storing feature values in Redis. This aligns with the earlier point about objects being a supported data type.

So, summarizing the data types based on the context:
1. Strings - as mentioned in 05.
2. Lists - discussed in page 19.
3. Sets - covered in page 14.
4. Objects (though not explicitly named) which are used for storing feature values, so that's a separate data type.

I need to make sure I include all these points and explain each one clearly based on the context provided without adding any extra information beyond what's already there.
</think>

Based on the provided context, Redis supports several data types for storing values. Here is an organized summary:

1. **Strings**: Strings are commonly used as a supported data type, though they can also be binary sequences.

2. **Lists**: Lists are another supported data type, often used to store linked lists of elements.

3. **Sets**: Sets are mentioned as unique unsorted string elements, which means each element in a set is distinct and cannot repeat.

4. **Objects**: Objects are used for storing feature values within Redis, particularly in the context of machine learning and data science.

These data types are explained using examples such as mset(), mget(), set(), incr(), and get() commands, along with mention of object storage in feature stores."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out the data types supported by Redis for storing values based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through each section carefully.

First, there's a section about Redis Data Types Keys, which lists several types like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes with geospatial data. That seems straightforward—these are all the possible value types I can expect for storing information in Redis.

Next, from ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" I see examples using the r.set, r.get commands. When a key is set to 0 and then retrieved, it increments the count. This tells me that Redis supports integers as well as strings, which makes sense because many databases use both types for different purposes.

Looking at other sections like ""Redis in Context 13"" and others, they all seem to confirm that Redis uses strings, lists, sets, etc., but not floats or dates unless specific commands are used. The examples with r.set and mset also show how these data types interact within Python code.

Putting it all together, the key points I have are: Redis supports strings for any kind of value. It handles lists, which are collections of items. Sets allow for unique values without duplicates. Sorted sets maintain order but still can contain duplicates if specified otherwise. Hashes store pairs where keys and values are both strings. Additionally, Redis includes geospatial data through specific commands.

I also see that in the Python examples, they use integers like 0 and dates with functions like mget, which further supports integer as a value type. So, I can confidently say Redis primarily uses these types for storing values: strings, lists, sets (with or without order), hashes (key-value pairs where both keys and values are strings), and geospatial data.

I should make sure there aren't any other specific types mentioned beyond the ones above. From what's provided, those seem to be the main support points.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for storing values include:

1. **Strings**: Used for most purposes, including key-value pairs where both keys and values can be strings.
2. **Lists**: Collections of items that are typically not unique unless specified.
3. **Sets**: Allow for unique item storage without duplicates; they maintain uniqueness but do not support order unless sorted.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Maintain order of insertion while allowing duplicates if explicitly allowed.
5. **Hashes (Key-Value Pairs)**: Store pairs where both keys and values are strings.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Includes geospatial information with similarity up to 0.17, though specific details about this may vary.

These data types are supported across Redis commands in Python through examples like r.set, r.get, mset, etc., demonstrating their versatility and ability to handle different types of values for various purposes."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the query about the data types supported by Redis for values. The user has provided a context with several sections, each discussing different aspects of Redis and its implementation with Python. 

First, looking at the first section titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", it mentions that Redis supports various binary sequences as values. These include strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which can be unique or unsorted), sorted sets, hashes, which output strings based on input, and geospatial data with specific similarity identifiers.

Next, the second section titled ""Redis + Python.pdf"" has several examples. It shows how to create a set using `r.set(key, value)`, retrieve it with `r.get(key)`. The example also demonstrates incrementing the count by 1 when the key is accessed: first retrieving the current count, then incrementing it, and finally checking again.

The third section seems to be about Redis in the context of data storage and machine learning (DS/ML), referencing a source for further reading. It doesn't directly mention any data types beyond what's discussed elsewhere.

Lastly, another section on ""Redis in Context 13"" with a link to a book also discusses how Redis is used within ML frameworks but again doesn’t focus on specific data types.

Putting this together, the key points are that Redis primarily uses strings for values. It supports sets, which can be unsorted or sorted. It also handles lists and hashes where the keys aren't stored in memory, only accessed when needed. Additionally, there's an example using sets with multiple keys and values, demonstrating how to retrieve them.

So, summarizing, the main data types Redis primarily uses include strings, sets (which can be unsorted or sorted), lists, geospatial data, and hashes. It also handles other types indirectly through commands like incrementing counters.
</think>

The primary data types supported by Redis for values include:

1. **Strings**: Used for most operations due to their simplicity and ease of manipulation.
2. **Sets**: Supports both unsorted and sorted sets. Unsorted sets are created using `r.set`, while sorted sets can be created with specific keys or indices.
3. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: These structures store elements in a linear fashion, with the first element being read first when accessed.
4. **Geospatial Data**: Redis supports geospatial data types, including coordinates and other spatial objects, which are crucial for applications like geolocation and mapping.
5. **Hashes**: These use strings as keys but do not store them in memory. They support operations like incrementing values based on key presence.

Additionally, the example provided demonstrates using sets with multiple key-value pairs, showing how to retrieve and modify data efficiently."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
