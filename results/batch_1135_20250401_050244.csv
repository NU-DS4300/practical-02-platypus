"Based on the provided context, I can answer your question accurately.

The EC2 lifecycle refers to the different states that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can be in:

1. Launch - This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. Start/Stop - This allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance, effectively pausing it like you would a computer.
3. Reboot - You can restart an instance without affecting the data on its root volume.
4. Terminate - Permanently delete the instance.

These lifecycle states allow you to manage your EC2 instances and adjust their usage according to your needs."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
