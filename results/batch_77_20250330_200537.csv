Alright, let's tackle this query. The user is asking me to name the data types in Redis that are supported for values, based on the provided context. Looking at the context, there's a section about Redis Data Types Keys which explains the data types and their values.

First, I need to identify the data types listed under ""Values"". The context mentions several: Strings, Lists (linked lists), Sets (unique unsorted string elements), Sorted Sets, Geospatial data with similarity 0.17, and others like BinaryVectors and Tuples.

Wait, there's also a mention of Tuples in one part and another section about tuples and geopoints. I should make sure to include both because they're relevant. Also, the value for Tuples is given as Geospatial data with similarity 0.17. 

I think that covers all the key points from the context provided. So, the user is looking for a list of data types Redis supports, and these are exactly those mentioned.

Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query about the data types supported by Redis for their value types. Let me start by recalling what I know.

First, from the context provided, there's a section on Redis Data Types Keys and Values. The keys listed are: Strings, Lists (which are linked lists), Sets (which contain unique elements and are unsorted), Sorted Sets (which maintain order), Hashes (they take strings as keys and return strings as values), and Geospatial data with similarity measures.

The query is asking to name the data types supported for their value types. So I think it's about what Redis uses for storing these value types. Let me go through each key:

1. **Strings**: The value type here is Strings, which makes sense because strings are used directly as values in Redis.
2. **Lists**: Since lists are linked lists and store elements by reference, they're suitable for list data types where order matters but duplicates can occur.
3. **Sets**: Sets contain unique elements without duplicates, so they don't allow duplicates, which is useful for certain kinds of datasets.
4. **Sorted Sets**: These have a natural order, making them good for ordered data like sorted lists or arrays.
5. **Hashes**: These store key-value pairs where the keys are strings and produce hash values. They're efficient for lookups but not meant to be stored as values per se.
6. **Geospatial Data with Similarity**: This is more of a feature that measures similarity between geospatial data points, not a storage type.

I should list each value type with their storage options. Also, I need to consider if there are any other supported types mentioned in the context. The context doesn't mention anything else, so I think these six cover all the possibilities for Redis's value types related to keys.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for storing values include:

- **Strings**: Used as direct values.
- **Lists (linked lists)**: Store elements by reference.
- **Sets**: Contain unique elements without duplicates.
- **Sorted Sets**: Have a natural order, ideal for ordered datasets.
- **Hashes**: Store key-value pairs where keys are strings and produce hash values.
- **Geospatial data with similarity**: A feature for measuring geospatial similarity.

These types support the value storage required by Redis."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to answer the query about the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context. Let me first read through the context carefully.

The context mentions that Redis supports various data types for values. The specific information is under the ""Values"" section, which lists strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which are unsorted and unique elements), sorted sets, and hashes, which take a string key and return a string value.

So, putting that together, the supported data types for values in Redis would be:
- Strings
- Lists
- Sets
- Sorted Sets
- Hashes

I should make sure these are all accurate according to the context. The example given in the context lists several elements under ""Values"" with their respective data types. I'll list them as they are provided.

I don't see any other information relevant to this query, so I don't need to add anything else unless there's a mistake or another point I'm missing. Wait, the context also says that some values include geospatial data and mentions similarity and geohash properties. But the question is about supported data types for values, not the specific operations with those values.

Also, I should ensure that I only mention the data types in lowercase since that's how they are typically written in documentation. So no need to change anything else.

Let me double-check: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. Yep, that covers all the points mentioned in the context related to value data types for Redis.
