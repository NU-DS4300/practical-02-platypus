Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, there are several documents and materials about Neo4j. Let me go through them step by step.

First, looking at the document from page 2 of Neo4j's PDF, it says that Neo4j was created in 2011 with a goal to provide a graph query language similar to SQL for graphs. That seems like an answer because it mentions the year 2011 when they were designed.

Then there's another document from page 1 of the same PDF talking about the graph database system, which supports both transactional and analytical processing. It mentions that Neo4j was developed with a focus on graph-based data support, so that aligns with the earlier statement about the query language being created in 2011.

Looking further down, there's another document from page 2 of introduction to the graph data model, which also discusses Neo4j and its supporting technologies. It doesn't explicitly mention the development timeline, but based on previous information that Neo4j was introduced around 2011 for graphs, it's reasonable to infer that the query language was created around that time.

Additionally, there's a document from page 1 of ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" that also references the graph data model and includes examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j. While this doesn't directly answer the timeline, it supports the idea that Neo4j was introduced for graphs in 2011.

The other documents seem to focus more on using Neo4j with various technologies like APOC plugins and Graph Data Science. They don't provide information about when the query language itself was invented but rather its use cases and integration with other tools.

Putting it all together, the most direct evidence from the context is the 2011 document where they were introduced as a graph query language for Neo4j. Therefore, the answer should be that Neo4j's graph query language was invented in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language was invented in 2011.

**Answer:** Neo4j's graph query language was invented in 2011."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. 

First, there are two PDFs mentioned related to Neo4j. The first one is from page 2 of ""10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011 - Goal: SQL-equivalent language for graph databases - Provides a visual way of matching patterns and relationships (nodes)-[:CONNECT_TO]->(otherNodes) - APOC Plugin - Awesome Procedures on Cypher - Add-on library that provides hundreds of procedures and functions - Graph Data Science Plugin - provides efﬁcient implementations of common graph algorithms (like the ones we talked about yesterday) 3) with similarity 0.18."" 

The second PDF is from page 1 of ""10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 1, chunk Neo4j - A Graph Database System that supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data - Relatively new class of no-sql DBs - Considered schema optional (one can be imposed) - Supports various types of indexing - ACID compliant - Supports distributed computing - Similar: Microsoft CosmoDB, Amazon Neptune 2) with similarity 0.21.""

Both documents are about Neo4j, discussing its graph query language and plugins. The first document mentions that the graph query language was created in 2011 as part of Goal, which I assume is about their goal to make it SQL-equivalent for graphs. The second document provides a brief introduction but doesn't mention the creation date.

Additionally, there's an ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" from page 20 that describes Neo4j, mentioning it supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data, is a new class of no-sql DBs, and mentions various features like indexing, ACID compliance, and distributed computing. It also touches on similar systems like CosmoDB or Neptune.

Given all this information, the key point is that Neo4j introduced its graph query language in 2011 as part of their development goals for making it SQL-compatible.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j. From the context provided, there are several documents mentioning it. One of them is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" on page 2, which talks about Cypher, a graph query language created in 2011. Another document is ""From 9 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" that supports the graph model and mentions ACID compliance with distributed computing.

Wait, so looking at those documents, they specifically mention Neo4j using Cypher starting from 2011. That seems pretty clear. I don't think it was invented in real-time; languages are developed over time. So the query language ""Cypher"" was created around that year. Therefore, the answer should be 2011.
</think>

The graph query language used in Neo4j was ""Cypher,"" which was created in 2011.
