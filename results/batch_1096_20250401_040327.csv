Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant part.

First, I see that in ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12)"", there's a chunk mentioning Redis being an open-source, in-memory database and sometimes called a data structure store. It also states that it's primarily a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. This suggests Redis is a popular library.

Then on page 14 of the same document, there's a chunk discussing Redis-py from madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/, which mentions Redis being maintained by the company itself and provides documentation. It also lists dependencies for Python.

On page 0, another mention of Redis is given in the context on the source website, where it's mentioned that Redis was released under the name ""Data Science"" by the company. 

So compiling this information: Redis was developed to be a data science tool but started as an open-source project with support for various models and data types. It has become popular as a library in Python and is maintained by the company. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Redis was released under the Data Science name by the company.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me go through each chunk carefully.

First, there are a few files listed: ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf"" with different chunks. Each time it's referred to as ""From 06 - ..."" So that's probably part of the same document or multiple parts. 

Looking at the first one, from page 12, the chunk is ""chunk Redis in Context 13"". The context mentions it's about Redis being used with Python and other models like Graph, Spatial, etc., as an in-memory database.

Then, another chunk says: ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17, chunk Redis DB - Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database - Primarily a KV store..."" Wait, this seems to be repeating the same information. It starts with ""From 05..."", so perhaps it's part of the NoSQL introduction.

The next chunk is about Redis and Python on page 14: ""Redis in DS/ML 15 Source: https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/"" So this links Redis to a feature store context, which might be about how Redis works with ML models. The similarity here is 0.29.

Then, from the same document, on page 1, it says: ""Redis-py 2 - Redis-py is the standard client for Python. Maintained by the Redis Company itself - GitHub Repo: redis/redis-py - In your 4300 Conda Environment: pip install redis"" and similarity is 0.31.

Looking further down, another chunk on page 6 says: ""Redis + Python.pdf (page 2, chunk Redis in DS/ML 15 Source: https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/) with similarity 0.28""

Wait, that seems to be the same content as before but maybe different pages? So perhaps it's a continuation or an alternative version.

I don't see any mention of Redis being released in these chunks. All the information points towards Redis being used in various contexts like Python and NoSQL databases, with some specific features about its client libraries and environments. There are mentions of Redis on GitHub as a repository but no details about when it was released.

So based on this context, I can't find any information indicating that Redis was actually released. It seems to focus more on how Redis is used in conjunction with other technologies rather than providing details about Redis's own release date.
</think>

Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating when Redis was released. The content focuses on Redis being used in Python and NoSQL contexts, along with some specific features of its client libraries and environments. There are mentions of Redis repositories and environments but no details related to Redis's own release date.

Answer: Redis was not explicitly released as per the provided context."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me look through each entry one by one.

First, there's a document from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf with the chunk ""Source: https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store."" The date mentioned here doesn't have a specific release year, so I can't use that info directly. Next, another version of the same PDF on page 12 has a similar chunk. Again, no release date is provided.

Looking at the other entries:
- From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf with ""Source: https://db-engines.com ranking..."" doesn't provide a release year.
- The document from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf on page 17 also lacks a release date.
- Another version of the same PDF starts at DS 4300, Redis+Python Mark Fontenot, PhD Northeastern University. The author mentions PhD Northeastern University, but I don't see a year listed.

All these documents are about Redis and haven't provided any specific details about when it was released. Therefore, based on the information given, I can't determine when Redis was actually released.
</think>
