"Based on the provided context, I can accurately answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the sequence of stages an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through during its life:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: You can temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance, effectively stopping it and then restarting it later.
3. **Reboot**: You can restart an instance without losing data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: This is when you permanently delete the instance.

These lifecycle stages allow you to manage your EC2 instances efficiently and effectively, depending on your specific needs and use cases."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context and my knowledge as a data engineer, I can confidently answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various stages an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through from its creation to deletion. These stages include:

1. **Launch**: When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance, allowing for easy restarting when needed.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance, freeing up resources and removing any associated data.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without affecting the data on its root volume, useful for maintenance or troubleshooting purposes.

These lifecycle stages are described in the provided context from Amazon's documentation, specifically from page 4 of ""EC2 & Lambda.pdf""."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"According to the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle consists of four stages:

1. **Launch**: When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Reboot**: Restart an instance without losing data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: Permanently delete the instance.

These stages are outlined in the context provided from page 4 of the ""EC2 & Lambda"" document, which describes the EC2 lifecycle (chunk EC2 Lifecycle)."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
