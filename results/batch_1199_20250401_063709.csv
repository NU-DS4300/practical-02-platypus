Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. From the context provided, I see that there's a section talking about Redis providing 16 databases by default. They're numbered from 0 to 15. 

Looking at the other sections, they mention Redis being an in-memory database and it can be used with various models like KV store, graph, spatial, etc. However, the main point here is that it supports 16 databases. 

I don't see any other information about different versions or releases of Redis beyond this context. The next section talks about using Redis with Python, specifically mentioning a simplified example and integrating it into ML workflows. There's also a source linked to FeatureForm.com explaining feature stores, which is related but not directly about the number of databases Redis supports.

So, based on the context provided, the key point is that Redis provides 16 default databases. The other sections don't add more information about additional versions or different types beyond that.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through each part of the context step by step.

First, in the NoSQL section at page 22, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It doesn't give a specific list of these names but just says they are numbered 0-15 with no other associated name. That's important because sometimes people might think the names are known like MySQL or PostgreSQL, but in reality, Redis offers more than those.

Next, on page 23, it talks about Redis being an open-source, in-memory database system that supports various models such as KV store, graph, spatial, full text search, vector, and time series. These terms mean different types of databases, but all are considered KV stores because they support key-value storage.

Then, looking at page 17, it lists Redis DB with a ranking of KV Stores at 18th out of others. That's another confirmation that Redis supports multiple KV store models beyond just its primary purpose as an in-memory database.

In the Python section on page 12, it mentions Redis in context 13, which further emphasizes that Redis is supported across different programming languages and tools. The link provided takes readers to documentation, so that reinforces that Redis isn't limited to a single tool or language.

Pages 14-15 talk about Redis being used in DS/ML (Data Science and Machine Learning) with examples like simplified examples and the feature store aspect. This tells me that Redis supports various data science applications beyond just in-memory storage, but it's still primarily an KV store.

On page 20, it lists Redis Data Types, Keys, and Values, mentioning strings, lists, sets, etc., but again, all under KV stores. The similarity scores provided are around 0.35 to 0.38, which is somewhat below average for such detailed descriptions, suggesting it's a bit more technical.

Page 21 continues by listing Redis Data Types and Keys with specific examples like Strings, BLOBs, JSON Objects, etc., all related to KV stores. This adds depth but again, the overall similarity score suggests it might not be as central or widely recognized in discussions of NoSQL databases.

In the connection to a server section on page 2, it explains Redis's client-side API with parameters like host, port, and db. It also mentions decoding responses to strings, which is crucial for developers working within Python but applicable across other languages too. The similarity score here is about 0.36, so it fits well into discussions of API details.

Finally, the Docker deployment section on page 4 explains that Redis can be set up in a container with specific host and port numbers. That's relevant if someone is considering deploying Redis within a particular environment but doesn't change its core support number.

Putting all this together, Redis supports multiple KV store databases beyond just MySQL or PostgreSQL. They include various data types under their key-value framework which makes them versatile for different applications. The context mentions that Redis creates 16 such databases by default, each with its own set of features, but the primary focus remains on the KV store nature throughout the discussions.

Redis supports a diverse range of databases within its suite, not limited to MySQL or PostgreSQL. Here's a concise summary:

- **Number of Databases**: Redis provides 16 databases (0-15) by default, each with unique features.
- **Primary Functionality**: These are KV stores that support key-value storage, including data types like Strings, BLOBs, JSON Objects, and Geospatial Data.
- **Application Scope**: While Redis is primarily a KV store, it also supports models such as Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, and Time Series.
- **API Details**: Redis offers various API parameters for connection to servers, applicable beyond Python and Docker deployment contexts.

In summary, Redis excels in data storage and processing with its key-value model, offering multiple databases across different programming languages."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, I see that it's talking about Redis as a remote directory server, which typically refers to in-memory databases. The first paragraph mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default with numbers from 0 to 15. That’s straightforward.

Looking further down, there are several sections discussing Redis and its compatibility or use cases beyond the basics. For example, one section talks about Redis databases as a ""data structure store"" and others mention it supporting various models like graph, spatial, etc., but those are not related to the number of supported default databases.

Another part discusses how Redis can be used in different programming languages, specifically mentioning Python. It doesn’t directly address the count of supported databases beyond the initial 16 mentioned before that particular section. So, focusing on the first paragraph and the direct quote about 16 databases numbered 0 to 15, I think that's the key point here.

I should make sure there aren't any other mentions in the context related to Redis databases or its default configuration. Scanning through, the most relevant part is definitely the line that says ""They are numbered 0 to 15."" That clearly states the total number of supported databases as 16. I don’t see any conflicting information elsewhere about Redis supporting more or fewer databases in different contexts.

Therefore, putting it all together, Redis supports a total of 16 default databases, each identified by numbers from 0 through 15.
