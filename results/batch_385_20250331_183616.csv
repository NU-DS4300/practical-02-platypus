Alright, let me try to figure out how to answer the query. The question is asking, ""How many databases does Redis support?"" and I have a bunch of context chunks from a PDF file. Hmm, I need to find where this information is provided.

Looking at the context, there are two PDFs mentioned: one on NoSQL Introduction with Redis and another on Redis + Python. The first document talks about Redis providing 16 databases by default, numbered 0 to 15. It mentions that direct interaction uses commands related to k/v pairs, which I think refers to key-value stores.

The second PDF is about connecting Redis with Python. It explains how Redis can be used in a Python environment, listing some models like KV store and others. But it doesn't seem to discuss the number of databases Redis supports directly there.

I remember that Redis is known for being an in-memory database, but sometimes people consider it as supporting multiple databases by default or by using different endpoints. However, from what I recall, Redis primarily uses a single database instance with commands like set and get, which apply to all k/v pairs regardless of the specific key-value system.

Looking back at the context, page 22 mentions Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered 0 to 15. So that should be the answer. The other documents discuss features but don't change this count of supported databases.

I think I can confidently say that Redis supports 16 databases in its default configuration.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each chunk step by step.

First, looking at the ""NoSQL Intro"" section, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15. So that's a key point there.

Then, in the ""Redis DB"" chunk, it says Redis is an open-source in-memory database system and supports various models like KV store, graphs, spatial, etc., but I'm focusing on the count of databases it provides. It also mentions that Redis has 16 databases by default, so that aligns with what I saw earlier.

The ""Connecting to the Server"" section talks about how to connect Redis to a container using Docker: localhost or 127.0.0.1 and port mapping. But this doesn't directly answer how many databases Redis supports; it's more about connection details.

Lastly, in the ""Redis + Python"" section under documentation, it mentions that Redis-py is the standard client for Python and supports multiple database models. The number 16 comes up again here as well.

So putting it all together, Redis provides 16 databases by default. Whether it's part of a NoSQL introduction or when connected to Python via Redis-py, the count remains consistent.

Redis provides 16 databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15. The context confirms this number in both the ""NoSQL Intro"" section and the documentation on connecting Redis to Python.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

First, there's a section about Redis databases in general. It mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. This is mentioned in paragraph 22 of the first file with similarity 351.42. So that's one part of the answer.

Then, on page 18 of the same document, there's a chunk about Redis as an in-memory database system. It says it supports durability features where data can be saved at specific intervals or appended only as a journal for roll-forward if something fails. This is mentioned again in paragraph 23 with similarity 456. Wait, but I don't see a direct mention of the number of databases here.

Looking further down, there's another file about Redis and Python (page 2) where it explains how to connect to Redis using Redis in Python. It mentions that you can use db as the key to connect to the database and uses redis.Redis with specific parameters: host 'localhost', port 6379, and setting decode_responses=True. This is a bit technical but doesn't add any information about the number of databases.

The subsequent paragraphs discuss Redis as a data structure store, which can be used in various models like graph or full text search. But this section seems irrelevant to the original query about how many databases Redis supports.

There's another file (06 - Redis + Python.pdf) on page 1 where it describes Redis-py as the standard client for Python and mentions that Docker deployments use host localhost or 127.0.0.1, port is mapped when created. It also says you can import redis and specify the database using db=2 with decode_responses=True. This again doesn't provide information on the number of databases.

So, summarizing, the only explicit mention in the context about Redis supporting a certain number of databases is the initial paragraph that states there are 16 by default. The other sections talk more about how to use Redis in Python for connection and durability features but don't add any numbers or details.
