Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me read through it carefully.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. They're numbered from 0 to 15. It also says there's no other name associated with them and mentions direct interaction through commands related to k/v pairs, which makes sense because Redis is known for its key-value storage solutions.

I don't see any part of the context that talks about different language libraries or variations. The focus here is on the default number of databases Redis has. So, even though there are 16 of them numbered 0-15, the answer should just be stating that it supports 16 databases.

The query was asking specifically about how many databases Redis supports, so I don't need to consider any other configurations or libraries beyond the default ones mentioned in the context.

The answer is: Redis supports 16 databases. These are numbered from 0 to 15."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, there's a section that mentions Redis provides 16 databases by default. It says they're numbered from 0 to 15 and doesn't mention any other names. So, based on that information, Redis has 16 databases in total. I don't think anything else is mentioned about it beyond the 16 numbered ones. Therefore, the answer should be straightforward.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases by default. They are numbered from 0 to 15 and there are no other names associated with Redis beyond this numbering.

**Answer:**

Redis provides 16 databases in its default configuration, numbered from 0 to 15."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me read through that again.

The context says: ""Redis provides 16 databases by default - They are numbered 0 to 15 - There is no other name associated."" Hmm, so if they say there are 16 databases from 0 to 15, then that means the total number is 16. 

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The context doesn't mention any other details like different names or variations beyond just numbering them. So it's straightforwardâ€” Redis by default supports 16 databases starting from 0 up to 15.

So the answer should be 16. Yeah, that makes sense.
</think>

Based on the provided context, Redis provides 16 default databases, numbered 0 through 15.
