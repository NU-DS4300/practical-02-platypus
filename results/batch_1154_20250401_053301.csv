Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From what I know, Neo4j is a graph database developed by Amazon. The context mentioned something about Cypher, which is the graph query language they use. The document also talks about how it's supposed to be a SQL equivalent for graphs and provides procedures through APOC. But that doesn't answer the question.

The user specifically asked when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. I don't think there was an explicit creation of Cypher or any proprietary technology from a company; instead, they're open-source software developed by Amazon. So, the language isn't ""invented"" in the traditional sense that might have happened naturally with someone discovering it. Instead, it's part of the toolset provided by Amazon.

So, the answer should be that Neo4j was not invented but rather created as a graph query language for their cloud-native database service. It doesn't have its own creation but is integrated into their system.

Neo4j's graph query language (Cypher) isn't ""invented"" in the traditional sense but is part of Amazon's toolset. They developed it as a feature within their cloud-native database to facilitate graph queries.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From what I remember, Neo4j is a graph database that comes from the company Neo. I think they were founded by a group of dot com entrepreneurs in the early 2000s.

I've heard that Neo4j developed its graph query language based on a similar idea to SQL but focused more on relationships and connections rather than just data storage. So maybe it was created around 2011 when they introduced it as a tool for managing connected data.

Looking at the context provided, there's a section about Cypher, which is part of Neo4j's query language. It mentions APOC Plug-in and the Graph Data Science Plugin. Those tools were probably developed in support of the graph query language, which suggests that the language was created during this time frame.

I'm pretty sure Neo4j started gaining traction with the release of its first product in 2013, but I think they were working on the query language before that. The development timeline likely spans several years, maybe around 2011 or 2012 when they decided to create a graph-focused query language.

I should double-check if there are any specific dates mentioned in the context related to this. From what's given, the first paragraph mentions Cypher and plugins but doesn't specify exact release years for the query language itself. However, the introduction of the graph database in 2011 and subsequent products up until 2013 might indicate that the query language was under development during that period.

So, putting it all together, I believe Neo4j's graph query language was invented around late 2011 or early 2012 when they began creating the cypher syntax to handle graphs effectively.

Neo4j's graph query language was invented in late 2011 and early 2012. This period saw the introduction of Neo4j as a graph database and the development of its cypher language, which aimed to provide a methodical approach for managing connected data by focusing on relationships and connections rather than traditional SQL structures.

**Answer:** The graph query language was invented around late 2011 or early 2012 when Neo4j was introduced as a graph database."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language, also known as Cypher, was invented. Hmm, from what I remember, Neo4j is a graph database developed by an unspecified company, probably using something like AWS. The context provided mentions that the goal of Neo4j was to create a SQL-equivalent language for graph databases, but it's called Cypher and not SQL.

In the query section, under Goal: ""SQL-equivalent language for graph databases - Provides a visual way of matching patterns and relationships (nodes)-[:CONNECT_TO]->(otherNodes) - APOC Plugin - Awesome Procedures on Cypher - Add-on library that provides hundreds of procedures and functions."" So it seems like they wanted a query language that feels familiar to SQL, but tailored specifically for graphs.

They also mentioned the Apoc Plug-in, which is part of Neo4j, providing hundreds of procedures and functions. That sounds a lot like a graph query language because you'd need special syntax to navigate and manipulate graph data structures. So Cypher was probably developed before the main database could even be created. 

Looking at the timeline, if Neo4j 1 came out around 2013-2014, then Cypher would have been in use by then as a query language that supported their graph structure. But since Neo4j was originally intended for graph databases and not SQL, maybe the query language was developed earlier, perhaps during its initial stages before it started supporting SQL databases.

So putting it together, Cypher was invented around 2013 when Neo4j 1 came out. It's designed to work with the graph structures that Neo4j creates using its schema engine, allowing users to write queries that navigate and analyze the data in a way similar to SQL but tailored for graphs.

Cypher was invented during the initial stages of Neo4j around 2013 when it first came out as a graph database. It was designed to serve as a query language that worked with the graph structures created using its schema engine, providing a visual and relational way to match patterns and relationships in data. This query language was later integrated into various applications, including the APOC Plug-in for Neo4j, offering hundreds of procedures and functions similar to those in SQL but focused on graphs. 

**Answer:** Cypher was invented around 2013 when Neo4j first came out as a graph database."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
