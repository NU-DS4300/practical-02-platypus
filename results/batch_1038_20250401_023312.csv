I don't know. The context provided does not seem to be related to the query about AVL trees or any specific requirement for multiple rotations. It appears to be discussing general concepts about data structures and querying, but there is no direct connection to AVL trees or rotation operations. If you have a different question or would like me to assist with something else, I'd be happy to help!|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant. 
Use the following context to answer the query as accurately as possible. If the context is 
not relevant to the query, say 'I don't know'."|What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?
I don't know. The provided context appears to be about data structures and search efficiency, but it does not mention AVL trees or any kind of imbalance that would require multiple rotations. Therefore, I'm unable to answer the query accurately based on this context. If you'd like to provide more information or clarify the question, I'll do my best to assist you!|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The context provided appears to be unrelated to AVL trees or any imbalances that may occur in them. The documents and pages mentioned seem to be discussing data structures, databases, and graph models, but there is no mention of AVL trees specifically. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query based on the given context.|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
