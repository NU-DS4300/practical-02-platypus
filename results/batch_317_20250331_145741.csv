Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this query where someone is asking about the data types supported by Redis for values. Let me go through the context provided to see if it mentions anything about data types in Redis.

Looking at the context, I can see that there's a section titled ""Redis DB"" which explains what Redis is and gives some details about its capabilities as a KV store. It also references Redis-py, mentioning it's a standard client for Python and that Redis is maintained by the company itself. But nothing about data types or their supported values.

Then there's another section under ""NoSQL Intro"" which talks about Redis as an in-memory database system but mentions durability features like saving snapshots or being append-only. However, this section seems more focused on functionality rather than specific data types it supports.

The query is pretty straightforward: ""Name the data types supported by Redis for values."" From what I can see in the context provided, there's no explicit mention of data types in any part that talks about values within Redis. It seems like the focus is more on how Redis interacts with other services or languages rather than the types it handles.

So, considering all this, I think the answer would be to say that Redis doesn't support specific data types, but it's capable of handling various data types through its KV model and interactions.

From the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data types supported by Redis. However, in general, Redis typically supports multiple data types through its KV store capability.

Answer: Redis primarily supports a wide range of data types, as many languages utilize it due to its versatility in handling different data structures."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, I need to figure out how to determine what data types are supported by Redis for their values. Let's start by looking at the context provided.

First, I see a section about Redis DB on page 17, which says it's an open-source in-memory database that can be used with various models like graph, spatial, etc., and doesn't handle complex data. It mentions the number of KV stores: 18, with similarity 0.37.

Then there's a section on Redis DB on page 22, which states it provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15, and that there's no other name associated for them. It also mentions direct interaction via commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs or variations and lists several language libraries available.

In the context provided, I don't see any sections that directly address data types supported by Redis as values. The main focus is on its structure, its functions, and some specific examples like graph models and lack of complexity support.

So, based on this, it seems like there aren't specific chunks in the provided context that talk about the data types used for values. The relevant parts discuss how Redis stores data as KV pairs, doesn't handle complex data, and provides a number of databases. However, without any direct information about data types here, I can't provide more specific details.

I should make sure to note this because if the user is asking about data types, but there's no such section, the answer would be ""I don't know"" based on the provided context.

The query asks for data types supported by Redis as values. However, in the provided context, I do not find any explicit information about Redis-supported data types. The main focus is on Redis's structure, database models, and number of defaults databases. Therefore, based on the available context, there is no specific mention of data types being supported for their values.

Answer: I don't know."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, let me try to figure out how I can help this user. They're asking about the data types supported by Redis for values. Looking at the context provided, they've given me a PDF section on Redis and Python. 

First, I'll scan through each paragraph to find where it mentions data types. Starting from page 19, it talks about Redis as an in-memory database system, discussing its durability features. It lists supported commands like KV store but also mentions other models like graph and full text search.

On pages 20-23, the first section describes Redis as a data structure store, primary for KV lookups with no secondary indexes. Then page 22 further details that it can handle various models and provides direct commands for interacting with multiple databases, numbered from 0 to 15.

Looking at the answer part, it lists specific data types like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, etc., under ""Values: - Strings..."" But wait, I don't see any mention of data types in the context provided. The query is about values, not keys. So maybe the user confused that.

I should check if Redis has any specific data types for storage or operations beyond what's listed on pages 19-23. However, from what I recall, Redis primarily uses strings and can handle various structures but doesn't have a list of all possible data types in its standard documentation. 

So the answer provided earlier is correct because it lists the values Redis supports without listing the actual data types used. But since the query is about values, which are more related to storage than keys, I should clarify that.
</think>

The context does not explicitly mention the ""values"" as in database keys but instead describes how Redis stores and handles data. However, based on the provided content:

- Redis supports various types of data such as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are sequences), and geospatial data.

But since the query is about values rather than keys, it's important to note that Redis primarily uses these for storage and operations but doesn't list a comprehensive list of data types. Therefore, the answer provided earlier correctly describes the data types Redis handles without listing all possible key types.

Answer: The context discusses Redis' supported commands (e.g., KV store) and its durability features (e.g., snapshots or journaling), not the specific data types it uses. Redis primarily works with strings, lists, sets, etc., but does not list a comprehensive list of data types for values."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
