Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking, ""How many databases does Redis support?"" Looking at the context provided, it talks about Redis providing 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. So that directly answers the question.

I should also check if there are any other details in the context that might influence this answer. The link mentions 23 points, but those aren't relevant here since we're focusing on the number of supported databases. The context doesn't mention anything about different naming conventions or variations beyond the numbered databases, so I don't need to go into more detail there.

Therefore, the answer is straightforward: Redis supports 16 databases.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let's start by reading through the context carefully.

The context mentions a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" and talks about Redis providing 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It says there are no other names associated with them. Then it goes on to discuss direct interaction commands related to k/v pairs and variations, but that's probably not relevant to the number of supported databases.

The query is asking how many databases Redis supports. Looking at the context again, it explicitly states that Redis has 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. The part about language libraries and other languages might be a distraction since the question is specifically about Redis's database count.

I should make sure I'm not missing anything else. The context doesn't mention any limitations or alternatives, so there are no other databases besides these 16. Therefore, the answer is straightforwardâ€”Redis supports exactly 16 databases.

Redis supports 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me look at the context again.

The context says that Redis provides 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. There's no other name associated with them. So that means Redis has 16 different k/v pairs available for direct interaction through commands related to setting and getting them. Also, it mentions language libraries are available as well.

Now, the query is asking how many databases Redis supports. The context does say they provide 16 databases by default, so I think that's the number we're looking for. However, since there are no other named databases mentioned beyond those numbered 0 to 15, it seems like Redis doesn't have additional named databases beyond these 16.

So, putting it all together, Redis supports 16 databases in total.
</think>

Redis supports a total of 16 databases by default. These are identified by numbers ranging from 0 to 15. They do not have any other specific names assigned to them besides being numbered k/v pairs.
