"According to the provided context from pages 19 and 5 of the ""Redis + Python"" document, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

Note that Geospatial data is also mentioned in the context, but it's not clear if this refers to a specific value data type or a separate feature. If you're looking for more information on Redis' geospatial capabilities, please let me know and I'll do my best to help!"|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
