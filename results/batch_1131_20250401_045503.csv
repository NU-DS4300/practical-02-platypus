Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which data types Redis supports for holding values. The user provided some context about Redis and some specific examples from their PDFs. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the context, there are sections on NoSQL introduction with Redis, Python integration, and a section on Redis in Context 13. Then, there's a part about Redis in DS/ML as well. 

From the first link, ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 19), it says that for Redis, strings are typically used as keys but can hold any binary sequence of values. So, I know strings are one of the main types.

Then, in the second PDF from ""Redis + Python.pdf (page 5)"", there's a section on string commands. They show how to create a key-value pair like r.mset({'key1': 'val1', 'key2': 'val2', 'key3': 'val3'}). Using redis_client.mget, they retrieve the values and get them as a list: ['val1', 'val2', 'val3']. This tells me that mget returns an array of strings when given keys.

In another section under ""Redis in Context 13,"" it mentions Redis data types keys like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are string to string), and geospatial data with similarity. So, I can see there's a detailed breakdown here as well.

Looking at the Python documentation link on page 5, they provide some commands: r.set, r.get, r.incr. The example given is setting a key, retrieving it, then incrementing the value. This confirms that values are stored as strings when using mset and other similar commands. 

The section in ""Redis in DS/ML"" seems to reference MadewithML's course on feature stores, which reinforces that Redis can be used for feature stores where data is organized into keys.

Putting it all together, the main data types Redis supports for values are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (strings), and geospatial data. The examples provided use strings, so I'm leaning towards the majority of these being strings unless specified otherwise.

I should make sure to mention that while some data types might have specific types like numbers or booleans, in this context, they're more commonly used as strings since there's no explicit example of them in the provided PDFs. Unless Redis has a different default type for those, which I don't think it does based on the information given.

So, my final answer should list all these data types and state that strings are the primary focus with others being optional or less common.

Redis supports several primary data types for holding values, primarily strings. While Redis can handle other types like lists, sets, hashes (strings to string), and geospatial data, these are more specialized cases not extensively used in the provided context. The main data types highlighted include:

1. **Strings**: Typically used as keys but can hold any binary sequence.
2. **Lists**: Organize values into linked lists for sequential access.
3. **Sets**: Store unique unsorted string elements, useful when duplicates are not desired.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain order, helpful in data sorted contexts.
5. **Hashes (Strings â†’ String)**: Convert keys to strings and can include geospatial data with similarity.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Manages 2D or 3D spatial data using similarity metrics.

The examples provided demonstrate string handling efficiently."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and its value storage mechanisms.

From the context provided, there are several pages discussing different aspects of Redis. For instance, in one section, it talks about ""Reversibility"" using a lock mechanism, which suggests that Redis allows writing data to a database while other processes write their own data, ensuring changes aren't duplicated elsewhere. This is important for applications where data race conditions could occur.

Another part mentions the use of commands like rpush and rset, which are used to store multiple values into a key. The ""r"" represents Redis's client object. So, I can see that the main value storage mechanisms in Redis are through keys or sets using rset, and lists using rpush.

Looking at some specific examples:

1. **Rpush**: When you use `rpush`, it adds multiple values to a set associated with a key. You might do something like:
   ```
   redis_rpush 'users' 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'
   ```
   This would create the set {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}.
   
2. **Rset**: The `rset` command is used to add multiple values in a specific order, which prevents issues with concurrent writes. An example:
   ```
   redis_rset 'users' Alice, Bob, Charlie
   ```
   This would store the list ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'].

The context also mentions that Redis supports various data types, such as strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which are unordered), hashes (which map values to other values), and geospatial data. Geospatial data includes information like latitude and longitude, which is useful for applications dealing with geographic coordinates.

Additionally, the context talks about how Redis can be used within Python or SQL contexts. In Python, it uses modules like redis_client to interact with Redis. The commands mentioned in that section include mget, mset, rpush, rset, rdel, and others, which are all part of Redis's data management language.

I should also consider if there are any other value types supported beyond strings, lists, sets, hashes, and geospatial data. From the context provided, it seems that these are the main types. However, I might want to confirm this with more recent information or articles, but based on what's given, those are the primary ones.

So, putting it all together, Redis supports several key value types for storing data:
- **Strings**: Characters and text.
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items that can contain any type of value.
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique values.
- **Hashes**: Mapped keys to values, which are useful for operations like lookups.
- **Geospatial Data**: Includes geographical information with associated properties.

I think I've covered all the main points from the context. To make sure, I should also consider if there are any other value types or data structures that Redis might support, but as far as I remember and the provided context goes, these are the primary supported types.

Redis supports several key-value types for storing data, which include:

1. **Strings**: Used to store text, characters, and special HTML entities.
2. **Lists**: Ordered collections of items that can contain any type of value.
3. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique values.
4. **Hashes (Map):** Mapped keys to values, useful for operations like lookups.
5. **Geospatial Data**: Includes geographical information with associated properties.

These types allow Redis to handle a wide variety of data requirements across different applications and use cases."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for holding values. From the context provided, there are several PDFs talking about Redis and Python. Let me go through each one step by step.

Starting with page 19 of the first PDF: It mentions strings and various sequences like lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. That's a good start. So Redis can store strings as keys, values, or IDs. Lists are collections of elements, which can be unique or unsorted. Sets are about unique elements, but they don't allow duplicates. Sorted Sets must maintain order, so that's an important point.

Moving to the second PDF on page 5: It shows examples of using mset and redis_client.mget with parameters like key1, key2, key3. When you call mget with multiple keys, it returns a list of values. So Redis can handle associative data structures by key-value pairs, which is useful for things like documents or JSON.

The third PDF on page 4 gives an example using r.set, r.get, and then incrementing the count. It calculates click counts as a hash. This shows that hashes are keys in Redis, mapping strings to other strings, which allows storing complex data structures efficiently.

Looking at the second PDF (page 19) again, it mentions geospatial data with similarity. That implies geospatial information can be stored and retrieved, but I'm not sure if this is a primary use case or more of an advanced feature.

The third PDF on page 4 also includes hset and hgetall, handling associative collections. So Redis supports sets that can have unique elements without duplicates and support for insertion and retrieval operations.

Page 12 talks about Redis being durability: it can save snapshots at specific intervals (a) or append-only with a journal (b), allowing roll-forward if something goes wrong. This suggests that while the main focus is on in-memory storage, the underlying data structures might need to be stored elsewhere for durability.

The third PDF on page 13 shows hset and hgetall functions, which handle keysets as sets of key-value pairs. So Redis can manage collection types beyond just simple lists by holding entire documents or JSON objects.

Putting this all together, I think Redis supports strings, lists, sets (both ordered and unordered), sorted sets, hashes (which are mappings from strings to strings), geospatial data, and hashs for collections like sets of key-value pairs. The durability feature is a separate concern but shows the importance of having persistent storage even if Redis is used for in-memory operations.

I need to make sure I cover all these points without getting too technical or just stating them. It's important to clarify that while Redis can handle complex data through various structures, it does have limitations with certain types like geospatial data due to their specific requirements.

Redis supports a range of data types for holding values, including:

1. **Strings**: Used as keys, values, or identifiers.
2. **List**: A collection of elements that can be unique or unsorted.
3. **Set**: Represents unique or unsorted elements; sets without duplicates.
4. **Sorted Set**: Maintains order, useful for sequences with natural order.
5. **Hashes (Hash)**: Maps strings to other strings, ideal for complex data structures like documents.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Handled through geospatial data types, supporting spatial queries.
7. **Hashs for Collections**: Supports sets of key-value pairs via hset and hgetall functions.

Redis also emphasizes durability with features like snapshots and a journal for roll-forward operations, but these are primarily for persistent storage."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
