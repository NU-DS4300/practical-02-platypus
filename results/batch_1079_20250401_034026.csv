Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me read through it again.

The context says that from a document about NoSQL introductions, page 22, chunk Redis Database and Interaction - It mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. They are numbered from 0 to 15. There's no other name associated with them, so they don't have a specific or alternative name listed.

The next part talks about direct interaction with Redis through commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs, which I think refers to key-value storage. It also mentions that there are many language libraries available as well, but the main point here is about the number of databases.

So putting it together, the context clearly states that Redis has 16 default databases in its default setup. They're numbered from 0 to 15. The other parts discuss how you interact with Redis using commands and mention languages but don't add any numbers beyond confirming the count.

Therefore, the answer should be straightforward: Redis supports 16 databases.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me read through it again.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. It also states that there's no other name associated with these 16, which means each number corresponds directly to a database without any additional naming conventions or variations beyond their numeric values. 

So, the question is asking how many databases Redis supports in total. Since it explicitly says 16 default ones numbered from 0 through 15, that should be the answer.

Wait, am I missing something? The context doesn't mention any additional libraries or support beyond the 16 numbered ones. It also mentions languages and interaction commands related to k/v pairs but doesn't touch on the count of supported databases beyond the 16 default ones.

Therefore, I think the answer is straightforward: Redis supports 16 databases.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, I know that Redis comes with a default set of databases numbered from 0 to 15. Each number corresponds to a specific database name, though some might be similar or have different names but same numbers. So, if it's 0 through 15, that makes 16 in total.

I should double-check if there are any other details or if the numbering changes with updates. But based on what's given, Redis starts at 0 and goes up to 15. I don't see any mention of other libraries or versions mentioned here, so it seems safe to go with 16 databases.

The context states that Redis comes with a default set of 16 databases numbered from 0 to 15. Therefore, Redis supports a total of 16 databases.
