Okay, I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause it to require multiple rotations. From the context provided, I see several documents and sections about data structures. The ones related are probably about trees and binary search trees since there's a section on balanced trees and imbalances.

In ""02 - Foundations.pdf"", I found a paragraph that defines a binary tree with left nodes less than parents and right nodes greater than parents. That seems like the structure of a standard BST. So, an AVL tree is a type of self-balanced binary search tree where each subtree's height doesn't differ by more than one from its adjacent subtrees.

I remember that in an AVL tree, if it unbalances due to inserts or deletes, we need rotations to rebalance it. The specific types of imbalances are either left or right leaning trees, which can cause the balance factor (height difference) to exceed 1. But how does this lead to multiple rotations?

I think when a node becomes too skewed on one side during an insertion or deletion, the tree needs to rotate to restore balance. For example, if the left subtree is significantly taller than the right, we need to move nodes from the right to the left to keep the height difference under control.

So, imbalances that require multiple rotations are those where there's a chain of nodes causing the unbalance on one side. Each rotation corrects a level, leading to more steps needed for rebalancing.
</think>

The imbalances in an AVL tree that necessitate multiple rotations are those where the tree becomes significantly skewed on either the left or right side. Specifically:

1. **Left or Right Rotation**: When the insertion causes the left subtree to become taller than the right (or vice versa), a rotation is performed from the right subtree (or left subtree) up.
2. **Chain Imbalance**: These imbalances are caused by a sequence of nodes where one side grows much faster, requiring multiple rotations to rebalance.

Thus, any unbalanced tree that results in a height difference greater than one necessitates one or more rotations to maintain its AVL balance.

**Answer:** The imbalance requires multiple rotations when the tree becomes significantly skewed on either side, leading to chain imbalances."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Hmm, I remember that AVL trees are balanced binary search trees, right? They maintain the property that for every node, the height of the left subtree is at most one less than the height of the right subtree. This helps keep the tree balanced and ensures operations like insertion and deletion can be done efficiently.

I also recall something about imbalances in other types of trees or data structures needing multiple rotations to rebalance themselves. For example, a binary search tree that's not perfectly balanced can cause left or right skewed paths when inserting new nodes, leading to inefficient operations because you have to traverse all the way down one side. So, for a skewed BST, you might need two rotation steps: first moving an element from the left subtree up and then another from the new left subtree.

But I'm specifically thinking about AVL trees. Since they require strict height balance, what kind of imbalance is causing them to need multiple rotations? I think it's when there are nodes in one subtree that are higher than their parent, which breaks the AVL property. For example, if a node has its right child as the same level as its parent or even one level lower but without any balanced parent, that could cause imbalances.

So, maybe when an AVL tree encounters such a situation during insertion or deletion operations, it needs to perform rotations. I think there are two types of rotations: left and right rotations. If you have a node where the right subtree is higher than expected, you might need one left rotation to balance it, but if that doesn't suffice because the new parent might also be too high, then another rotation from the opposite direction is needed.

Wait, let me think about this again. In an AVL tree, after inserting or deleting a node, we first check the balance factor (height difference between left and right subtree) of the relevant nodes. If any imbalance occurs, we perform rotations until all nodes satisfy the AVL property.

So, if there's a single level where some nodes have too high a balance factor, you might need one rotation to fix it. But if that causes another node on the same path to also be unbalanced, you'll have to do two different rotations in opposite directions. That makes sense because each rotation can adjust only one part of the tree at a time.

I'm pretty sure this is called an ""imbalance requiring multiple rotations"" or something like that. It's not just any imbalance; it's specifically when certain nodes on one side are too unbalanced, necessitating two different adjustments to balance everything.
</think>

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when there are specific nodes with heights significantly higher than their parent nodes, leading to a situation where more than one adjustment is needed. Specifically, when inserting or deleting data causes certain nodes on one side of the tree to exceed their expected height difference, two rotations—one from each subtree—may be necessary. This ensures that all nodes maintain the AVL property by rebalancing the heights appropriately.

**Answer:** The imbalances requiring multiple rotations in an AVL tree involve nodes where one side has a significantly higher balance factor than the other. For example, when the right subtree of a node is too high compared to its parent, a left rotation may fix this, but if another subtree becomes unbalanced after that, a right rotation may be needed. This dual adjustment ensures all nodes maintain the AVL property by balancing heights across affected areas.

**Answer:** The imbalances requiring multiple rotations in an AVL tree are those where certain nodes on one side of the tree have heights significantly higher than their parent nodes. For instance, when the right subtree is too high compared to its parent, a left rotation may balance it, but if another node becomes unbalanced after that, a right rotation may be needed.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause it to require multiple rotations to rebalance. From the context provided, I see several documents about data structures and algorithms.

The first document is from 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf. It mentions arrays of tuples (specialVal, rowNumber) for trees and linked lists for arrays. It talks about binary searches using a sorted array and linked lists with linear scans during insertion. Also, there's a mention of weight vs unweighted nodes in a graph context.

The second document is from 02 - Foundations.pdf, which details the array of tuples approach to trees as an array of (specialVal, rowNumber) tuples sorted by specialVal. It suggests using binary search for quick lookups and linking insertions into this sorted structure. However, inserting into a linked list would require linear scans during insertion.

There are also mentions of cyclic vs acyclic data structures, which is something I might need to consider as part of the tree's structure.

Looking at the query about imbalances in an AVL tree requiring multiple rotations, I should recall that AVL trees maintain balance by ensuring their heights differ by at most one. When a node becomes unbalanced due to an insertion or deletion, the tree needs rotation to rebalance. The types of rotations—left-right and right-left—are needed when the imbalance is deeper than just a single level.

So, if there's a significant imbalance, like a node has been moved far up, multiple rotations might be necessary because each rotation can only fix an imbalance at one level deep. This means that for imbalances requiring more than two levels of rebalancing, multiple rotations would be needed to restore the tree's balance.
</think>

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when a node has been shifted beyond just a single level deep. These scenarios necessitate both left-right and right-left rotations because each rotation can only address an imbalance at one depth level. Consequently, for deeper imbalances, multiple such rotations are needed to rebalance the tree.

**Answer:** Multiple rotations are required when imbalances cause nodes to be shifted beyond the immediate level, necessitating adjustments in different directions through left-right or right-left rotations."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
