Okay, I need to figure out what Redis supports for its values based on the context provided. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the NoSQL DB section, it mentions that Redis is considered an in-memory database system and can be very fast. It supports durability with snapshots or append-only files that can be rolled forward if something goes wrong. Redis doesn't handle complex data like geospatial data but does support things like sets, lists (linked lists), sorted sets, hashes (which are strings to string mappings), and geospatial data similar to GeocentricDB 20. But wait, I think it's mentioned as ""with similarity"" so maybe that’s just an example of a geospatial structure.

Next, looking at the Redis DB section, the context says Redis provides 16 databases by default for KV stores, which are key-value pairs. It also mentions that Redis is primarily a KV store but can be used with other models like graphs, spatial, full text search, etc. So in terms of value types, it's primarily suited for KV stores.

Now, the query asks specifically about data types supported by Redis for values. The NoSQL DB part talks about data types but doesn't list specific ones beyond what I know. Redis supports strings as both keys and values. Lists are linked lists where each element can be a key or value. Sets are unique, unsorted elements. Sorted sets maintain order. Geospatial data is supported with some similarity to the mentioned example.

But wait, in the NoSQL section under ""Values,"" it says strings, lists, sorted sets, hashes (strings→strings), and geospatial data 20). It also mentions that geospatial data supports similarity as 0.31 which might be a score for handling such data correctly.

Putting this together: Redis handles strings, lists, sorted sets, unique elements in sets (sorted), hash structures (key-value pairs), and geospatial data. There's no mention of other types like objects or arrays beyond the set type, but I think it can handle JSON-like objects since they're mappings from keys to values.

Wait, in the section on languages available, it says Redis has language libraries for Python, which is a point about Python integration later on, not directly related to value types. So focusing back, the key data types are strings, lists, sets (sorted), hashes, and geospatial.

I should make sure there's no other information missing. The context doesn't mention any other data structures or more complex types beyond what's listed.

Redis supports several key-value type systems, including:

- **Strings**: Strings can be keys or values.
- **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Each element is a key-value pair in this structure.
- **Sorted Sets**: Unique elements ordered by insertion time.
- **Hashes (Key-Value Pairs)**: Support similarity operations as mentioned, with a score of 0.37.
- **Geospatial Data**: A geospatial data type similar to GeocentricDB 20, with a similarity score of 0.31.

These types are primarily suited for Key-Value stores but can handle other structures like sets and lists as well.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for their values. From the context provided, it seems like there's some information about Redis as an in-memory database system and its various commands.

First, looking at the sections related to Redis DB, I see they mention Redis provides 16 databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15. The main command mentioned is r.set(), which sets a key-value pair. Then, there's r.get() for retrieving values. 

In the Python documentation section, they provide some commands that directly interact with Redis data. For example, r.set(), r.get(), and r.incr(). Additionally, they show how to get multiple values using mget(). These seem to be specific commands related to managing key-value pairs.

I also note that there are other language libraries available for working with Redis data. The documentation mentions mset() for putting values into a set, mget() for retrieving from a set, and mlist() for lists. This suggests that Redis supports these types of operations in various programming languages.

The context doesn't discuss geometric types or geospatial data since the section about geospatial data is numbered 20. So I can focus on standard key-value pairs supported by Redis commands.

Putting it all together, Redis primarily handles string keys and values but also supports lists (linked lists) through mlist(), sets with unique elements, sorted sets for order, hashes mapping strings to strings, and binary sequences like geospatial data if that's relevant. They don't have explicit secondary indexes, which makes sense since they're a KV store.

So the supported data types are primarily string values, but also lists, sets, and hashes. Geospatial data with similarity is covered in another section on pages 19 and 20.

Redis supports several data types for handling key-value pairs, including:

- **Strings**: For simple or complex strings.
- **Lists**: Implemented as linked lists of elements.
- **Sets**: Supports unique, unsorted string elements. Note that sets are not indexed by key but can have duplicate values if supported by the driver.
- **Sorted Sets**: Can be sorted to maintain order, though duplicates may still exist unless specified otherwise.
- **Hashes**: Maps keys (strings) to values, supporting lookups.

These operations are facilitated through Redis commands like `r.set()`, `r.get()`, and `r.incr()` for managing data. Additionally, language libraries such as mset(), mget(), and mlist() are available for further exploration of these commands in various programming contexts."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, looking at page 19 of the NoSQL document, it mentions that Redis supports several data types like strings, lists, sets, etc. The value type is specified as ""Strings,"" and other related types are listed too.

Then in the Redis DB section on page 20, it's clear that Redis primarily acts as a KV store but can handle various models. It doesn't require complex indexes but supports lookup by key for all supported data types except hashes, which use string keys based on values.

The Python section (page 6) shows examples of how to interact with Redis using Python commands. They demonstrate setting, getting, incrementing values, and retrieving them. This confirms that Redis can be used for different operations, not just simple lookups.

In the context about connecting a data source in NoSQL, it mentions testing Redis connection successfully. So, from all these points, Redis supports a variety of value types, including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes with string keys derived from values, and geospatial data for similarity purposes.

I should list each supported data type with its specific name as mentioned in the context to be accurate.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

1. **Strings**: The primary value type used for storing text or alphanumeric strings.
2. **Lists (sorted)**: A linked list structure that allows efficient addition and removal of elements, allowing null insertion but not duplicates.
3. **Sets**: A collection where each element is unique. While sets do not support duplicate entries, they can have sorted order.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to lists but with the added capability of maintaining an ordered structure based on a key.
5. **Hashes (default)**: Each value in a hash is associated with a unique string key derived from its content.
6. **Geospatial Data 20**: A binary sequence representing geospatial coordinates, used for similarity purposes.

These data types can be accessed and manipulated using Redis commands such as SET, GET, INCR, MSET, MGET, and others."|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
