Okay, so the user is asking when Redis was released. They provided a context from a document that includes information about Redis being an Open source, in-memory database used for Key-Value Stores like KV stores, but also other types of databases. The document mentions it's primarily a KV store with specific details on its ranking and similarity. However, there's no mention of when Redis was actually released.

My task is to figure out if I can use the provided context or if I need to add more information. Since the context doesn't talk about Redis's release date, I don't have that data. I remember Redis being released around 2016 by Google in Mountain Park. But without the exact release year mentioned in the context, I can't provide an accurate answer.

I should respond by acknowledging the lack of information and then add my own knowledge about when Redis was released. That way, I'm being helpful while still respecting the user's request to use the provided context if possible.

The context does not provide information on when Redis was released. Redis is mentioned in the context as an Open source, in-memory database that serves as a Key-Value Store but also can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, etc. However, there is no specific mention of its release date within this context.

I know Redis was released around 2016 by Google in Mountain Park."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, let me figure out how to answer the query about when Redis was released. The user provided a context that mentions Redis is an Open source in-memory database known as a KV store. It also lists other models like Graph, Spatial, etc., and gives some ranking details. The query is specifically asking when Redis was released.

Hmm, from what I remember, Redis was released around 2012. I think the first version was Redis 1.0 in early 2012, which introduced concepts like sets and storehouse IDs. They expanded to multiple storage engines in subsequent versions. The exact year might be 2012 or later, but I'm pretty sure that's when Redis gained widespread adoption.

I also recall that the document mentioned Open source and in-memory database aspects, which reinforces that Redis was around early 2012. It seems like a stable version by then. So putting it together, Redis was released in 2012.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the context provided. Let me read through the query and context again.

The query is ""When was Redis released?"" And in the context, there's a section about Redis (Remote Directory Server) which mentions it as an Open source, in-memory database that can be used with various models like KV store, graph, spatial, etc. It also lists some engine names but doesn't mention when Redis itself was released. The paragraph ends with Redis being referred to as the ""Remote Directory Server"" and its source is db-engines.com.

Hmm, so the context doesn't explicitly state when Redis was released. It only mentions it's an open-source in-memory database that can be used with different models. It doesn't provide a specific release date or year. Therefore, based on the given context, I don't have enough information to answer when Redis was actually released.
