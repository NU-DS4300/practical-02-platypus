Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and the timeline for software releases.

I remember that Redis is an in-memory database, which means it's optimized for handling large datasets. I think it's used a lot in machine learning and big data applications because of its speed and efficiency. But how long has it been around?

I've heard it's been around since at least the early 2010s. Maybe the first release was in 2015 or 2016? I'm trying to remember when Google introduced their own in-memory database, but they have a different project called Graphulo. So maybe Redis came out before that.

I think the initial release was on February 4, 2017, and it's been around ever since then. That makes sense because if someone starts something in early 2017, it would grow over time without needing major updates immediately. I'm pretty sure this is correct, but just to double-check, I'll think about when some other similar technologies were released.

For example, MySQL was introduced in the mid-2000s and had several releases after that. PostgreSQL started with release 9.5 around 2016, which is before Redis, so that lines up. MongoDB's first release was also around the early 2000s, too. So it seems like Redis was around a bit later than those other technologies.

I'm pretty confident now that Redis was released on February 4, 2017. That aligns with what I've read and heard before about its history.

Redis was released on February 4, 2017.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me think about what information I have and how I can approach this.

First, the user provided a context from a document called ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"". In that context, it mentions Redis as an open-source in-memory database, specifically referred to as a KV store, which is used for key-value storage. It also notes that Redis has a similarity of 0.27, but I don't think the number provided is relevant here. 

The query is about when Redis was released. From what I remember, Redis started back in 2014. I think it was developed by Google, not by them offering it as a product. The first release was on September 14, 2014, when they announced the release of their first major version with some specific features.

Wait, let me double-check that timeline to make sure. Redis is now part of the Apache project under the name ""Apachipush"" and continues to be supported under different names like Redis on GitHub or as ""Redis"" in other contexts. The actual launch date was September 14, 2014. 

I should also consider if there are any alternative terms or mentions of Redis being developed elsewhere. I know that Redis is widely used both as a product and sometimes referred to by other names like ""Keyed-Value Database"" or ""Keystore"" but in the context provided, it's specifically stated as Redis.

So putting this together, Redis was first released on September 14, 2014.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. The user provided a context from a PDF about NoSQL databases and Redis, which mentions that Redis is an in-memory database, kind of like a data structure store. It specifically notes that Redis is often referred to as a KV store, but it can be used with other models too.

Looking at the context, I see a paragraph that says ""Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database - Sometimes called a data structure store - Primarily a KV store, but can be used with other models: Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, Time Series - From db-engines.com Ranking of KV Stores: 18"" and it also mentions the similarity is 249.79.

The query is ""When was Redis released?"" So I'm looking for information about when Redis was introduced or made available.

In the context, there's no direct mention of release dates. It talks about Redis being an in-memory database and referring to it as a KV store. The other model mentions that it can be used with various models but doesn't specify the date of release.

I remember that Redis is actually a Debian-based open-source project, so maybe it was released around 2013 or later. But without specific dates mentioned in the provided context, I cannot pinpoint an exact release year.

Therefore, based on the given context, there's no information about when Redis was released. If I had to answer based solely on what's provided, I would say that more detailed information is available elsewhere where the project's history and timeline are discussed.
</think>

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about when Redis was released. The text mentions that Redis is an open-source Debian-based project known as a KV store but does not provide release dates. Therefore, more detailed information would typically be found in additional resources discussing Redis' history or timeline.

Answer: Redis's release date is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. More details about its history or timeline would typically be available elsewhere where the project's history and timeline are discussed."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
