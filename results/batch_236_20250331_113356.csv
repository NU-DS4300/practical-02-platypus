However, I must say that the context provided has nothing to do with AVL trees or data structures. The context appears to be discussing limitations and challenges of relational databases and NoSQL databases.

Given the query is asking about imbalances in an AVL tree requiring multiple rotations, it seems this question falls outside the scope of the original context.

To answer the query to the best of my ability:

In a perfectly balanced AVL tree, each node has at most one more child than its sibling. If there's an imbalance (e.g., one side is too tall or short), the tree needs to be rebalanced through rotations to maintain this property. A single rotation can resolve minor imbalances, but if the imbalance is severe, multiple rotations might be required.

Here are the possible scenarios that may require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-heavy imbalance**: If a node has many more children on its left than right, it's likely to require multiple rotations to re-balance the tree.
2. **Right-heavy imbalance**: Similar to the previous scenario, if a node has many more children on its right than left, multiple rotations might be needed.
3. **Deep imbalance**: If the imbalance is very deep in the tree (i.e., it affects multiple levels), multiple rotations may be required to restore balance.

Please note that these are general explanations and not specific to AWS or relational databases.

"I'd be happy to help! However, I must say that the query ""What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?"" doesn't seem to have any relevance to the context provided.

The context is about relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo, and AWS. It mentions challenges with relational databases such as schema evolution over time, ACID compliance, joins being expensive, semi-structured or unstructured data, and horizontal scaling presenting challenges.

An AVL tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree data structure, which doesn't seem to be related to the context provided. Therefore, I would not be able to answer this query accurately based on the given context.

"I must say that the context provided is not directly relevant to the query about AVL trees. The context appears to be discussing the limitations and challenges of relational databases, while the query is asking about a specific data structure (AVL tree) used in computer science.

However, I'll do my best to answer the query to the best of my ability.

In an AVL tree, multiple rotations are required when there is an imbalance that cannot be resolved by a single rotation. This can occur when the height of one subtree differs from the height of the other subtree by more than a certain threshold (usually 1).

There are two types of imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-left imbalance**: When the left child of a node is also the left child of its parent, and this pattern continues, requiring multiple rotations to restore balance.
2. **Right-right imbalance**: Similar to the above case, but occurring on the right side of the tree.

In both cases, multiple rotations are necessary to maintain the AVL tree's self-balancing properties and ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
