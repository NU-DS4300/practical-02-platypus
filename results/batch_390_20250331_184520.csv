Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and its history. I remember that Redis is an in-memory database, which makes it very efficient for operations where you don't have a lot of data to store on disk or backing up. That must mean Redis has been around longer than traditional relational databases.

I think Redis was first released in 2005. Wait, but when exactly? Maybe around 2011? I remember seeing something about it being developed by Google, and they had some early versions before. Oh right, there's a project called ""Drift"" that Redis built for performance on databases with slow access speeds. So maybe Redis was released after that.

I should check if there were any major updates or changes in the development timeline. From what I recall, Redis 1.0 might have been around from 2008 to 2009. It introduced some key features like hashing and a more efficient database structure. But it wasn't released until 2011? Hmm, that doesn't sound right because the initial version was around 2005.

Let me try to piece this together. Redis was created in 2005 by Google's Cloud Knights project. Before that, there were other in-memory databases like MongoDB and HBase. In 2008, Google released Drift for better performance on older hardware, which led to Redis becoming more popular and widely adopted.

So, Redis was first released as a separate product in 2011 when it started using the Drift engine. The engine improved performance by reducing access times and handling large amounts of data more efficiently. This was a big deal because other applications were struggling with slow or outdated hardware.

I think that's about right. Redis wasn't around before 2011, but after Google released Drift in 2008, Redis took off and became a leading in-memory database.

Redis was first released in **2011** as part of the Drift engine, which improved performance by reducing access times and handling large datasets more efficiently."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. I've heard a few times that Redis is an in-memory database system. That seems pretty significant because it's supposed to be faster than traditional databases which use disk storage. 

I remember seeing some documentation before where Redis was introduced, maybe around 2008 or so. There was a lot of talk about its performance and how much better it could be compared to other systems that used disks. I think there were some articles or whitepapers published back then.

In one document, the context part mentions Redis as an in-memory database system, which is a big deal because it can handle data without disk space. It also talks about durability features: snapshots are saved at specific intervals and changes can be rolled forward if something fails. That's why it's often used with cloud environments where you don't want to store too much data on disk.

Another document from the same context is about Redis in Python, which I think was a significant milestone for integrating Redis into Python applications. The documentation might have highlighted its popularity and what users expected from an in-memory database system.

I also saw that Redis has been open-source since 2009, as mentioned in another part of the context. That makes sense because being open-source encourages community contributions and improvements. They've been around for a while now and haven't hit any major issues or failures, which is great for long-term development.

Looking at the document from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf, it specifically mentions Redis-py as the standard client for Python. That suggests that Redis was being used actively in Python development, showing its importance to developers working with Python.

Since Redis was introduced back in 2008 and it's maintained by the Redis company, which is a big name in open-source communities, I think the release date should be around that time. Maybe around early 2008 or 2009. 

I also remember seeing a timeline for when databases are released from major companies like Redis, which helps in understanding their lifecycle and how long they've been around. Since Redis is an older database but has gained popularity, it's possible that it was first introduced in the early 2000s.

So putting this together, I think Redis was introduced starting around 2008, likely around late 2007 to early 2008. The documentation from earlier times would support that by mentioning performance improvements and being an open-source project. The integration with Python in 2006 further solidifies its importance for developers.

Redis was introduced in the mid-2000s, specifically starting around late 2007 or early 2008. It gained popularity due to its performance advantages and durability features, such as snapshots and roll-forward functionality. The integration of Redis into Python in 2006 further highlighted its significance for developers. Since then, it remains a popular open-source database system known for its in-memory capabilities and strong community support.

Answer: Redis was introduced around late 2007 or early 2008."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so the user is asking about when Redis was released. Let me look through the context they provided to find any information related to release dates.

Looking at the context, I see sections discussing Redis as an in-memory database system and a Python client. The document mentions that Redis was developed starting in 2009 by C++ developers. It also states that Redis is now known for being very fast with over 100,000 set operations per second.

The documents don't mention Redis's release date; they just talk about its development and speed as a database. Since there's no explicit information provided in the context about when Redis was actually released, I should consider whether to include an answer based on the available data or if I can infer it from other sources.

I know that Redis was started in 2009 by C++ developers but hasn't been officially released yet as a product. The initial releases were mostly pre-alpha and beta versions until around 2014, when they made their first public release in August 2014 called Redis 1.x.

Wait, the user didn't mention anything about a specific version number or release date in the context, so I can't provide an exact date. Therefore, it's safer to inform them that the information isn't available based on the given context and advise checking official sources for precise details.
</think>

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about Redis's release date. The documents mention that Redis was developed starting in 2009 but do not specify when it was officially released as a product or service. As of now, Redis has been operational since at least August 2014 with its first public release called Redis 1.x."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
