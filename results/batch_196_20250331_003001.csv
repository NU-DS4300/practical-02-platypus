Okay, so the user is asking when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. I need to figure this out based on the context they've provided.

Looking at the context, there are a few files mentioned but none directly relate to Neo4j itself. The first file is about 10 - Neo4j.pdf, which mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011 as a graph query language for database processing. That seems relevant.

The other files are more about the general structure of Neo4j and its similarities with other systems like CosmoDB and Neptune. They talk about transactional and analytical processing, graph data models, indexing, ACID compliance, and distributed computing. These don't directly address when Neo4j was invented but provide context about how it works.

The query is specifically about the invention date of Neo4j's graph query language. Since none of the provided content mentions this, I should consider that the context doesn't include information on the creation date of Neo4j's query language itself. 

Therefore, based on the given context, there's no direct information about when Neo4j was invented for its query language. So the answer would be to say ""I don't know"" because the provided context isn't relevant.

The context does not directly provide information on when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. However, it mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011 as a graph query language for database processing.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. The user has provided a lot of context from various documents about Neo4j and graph databases in general. Let me go through each document one by one to see if any mention the invention or introduction of the query language.

First, looking at the PDFs on ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011)"", it says that Neo4j was introduced with Cypher in 2011. So this document indicates the year as 2011.

I should check other documents to see if they mention a different year or earlier introduction. The next PDF is ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 20, chunk Neo4j - A Graph Database System...)"", which starts with an introduction of graph databases but doesn't specifically mention the query language.

Then there's another document titled ""05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", page 4. It mentions that NoSQL was first used in 1998, but that's more about the term and its history, not specifically about Neo4j introducing Cypher.

Looking at ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 1, chunk ... Graph Algorithms...)"", it doesn't mention a year for when Cypher was introduced. It just says created in 2011.

There's also another document ""From 07 - Document DBs and Mongo.pdf"" which talks about MongoDB but again doesn't mention the query language introduction of Cypher.

The last document is ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 1, chunk What is a Graph Database...)"", which again just describes the model without mentioning when Cypher was introduced.

So from all these documents, the only one that directly mentions Neo4j introducing the graph query language is in the first document. It says Cypher was created in 2011. The other documents don't provide specific information on when Cypher was actually introduced, so I can't be certain it was before 2011 or after.

Therefore, the answer should state that Neo4j's graph query language (Cypher) was introduced in 2011 based on the provided context.

The Neo4j graph query language, which is referred to as Cypher, was introduced in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me see the context provided. The user shared several documents about Neo4j and some other related topics like A Graph Database System and introduction to graph data models.

Looking at the context, there are mentions of Cypher being used in Neo4j for querying graphs. I remember that Cypher is a query language similar to SQL but designed specifically for graph databases. There's also something about APOC Plugins, which are additional functions provided by Neo4j on top of its core Cypher.

In one document, it says: ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011."" Wait, that's an important point. It mentions that the Query Language and Plugins were created by Neo4j in 2011. So, this must be when Cypher was introduced as part of the query language.

Additionally, there's a mention from ""From 07 - Document DBs and Mongo.pdf"" about MongoDB being an older documentdb service released in 2016. However, that doesn't relate directly to Neo4j itself. The Cypher part is specifically linked to Neo4j's introduction in 2011.

So putting this together, the query language in Neo4j was created starting around 2011. That seems like the correct answer based on the provided context.

The graph query language in Neo4j was introduced around 2011.
