Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by reading through the context provided.

First, the context includes a PDF titled ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher"" from page 2. It mentions that the goal is to create a graph query language similar to SQL for graph databases. That makes sense because Neo4j uses Cypher for querying graphs. The context also refers to an APOC Plugin, which I think stands for Apache Oscillate Protocol and Cloud. This suggests that there's a plugin developed by the Apache project to enhance Neo4j's capabilities.

Looking further down, another PDF titled ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" is referenced from page 20. It explains that Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data. The model was introduced as a relatively new class of no-sql databases, which means it hasn't replaced SQL yet but offers some unique features.

The section mentions that Neo4j supports various types of indexing, ACID compliance, distributed computing, and is ACID compliant. This indicates that the query language (Cypher) includes certain database constraints to ensure data consistency and reliability.

Additionally, one PDF from page 3 discusses how Neo4j can be integrated into Docker Compose version 4 with a similarity score of 0.45. This suggests that the language is compatible with other tools in the containerization ecosystem, which might indicate it's widely adopted or at least supported across different platforms.

The last PDF is about graph algorithms from page 2. It references Needham and Hodler's book on Apache Spark and Neo4j, mentioning their practical examples using both services. This shows that Neo4j has a strong community support and application base.

Putting all this together, the timeline seems to start in 2011 when Neo4j was created. The Cypher query language developed at that time, with APOC plugins added for graph data science features, aligns with that initial launch. There's no specific mention of earlier versions beyond the creation date.

So, putting it all together, Neo4j's graph query language was invented in 2011 when it was first introduced.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. 

The first chunk of the context talks about Neo4j in the context of Cypher, which is a graph query language. It mentions that Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing and was created in 2011. That seems relevant to my question.

Then there are several other documents like ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" and another from the same context. These mention things like supported indexing, ACID compliance, distributed computing, and similarities with other systems like CosmoDB or Neptune. They also talk about graph data model support but don't specifically touch on Neo4j.

Looking at the query section: ""When was neo4j's graph query language invented?"" The context says that Neo4j's graph query language is created in 2011 under the Cypher document from page 2. So that should be the answer.

I don't see any other relevant documents here that provide information about when Neo4j introduced its graph query language. All the others are more about what Neo4j does and how it compares to other systems but not about its history or development timeline.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j introduced its graph query language. I remember seeing some context about Neo4j being a graph database system that supports both transactional and analytical processing. There were mentions of it alongside other no-sql databases like Microsoft CosmoDB and Amazon Neptune.

Looking at the provided context, there are several files listed with their page numbers and chunks. The first file is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4jâ€™s graph query language created in 2011..."" That makes me think Neo4j was created around 2011.

The other files discuss the introduction of graph data models but don't directly mention Neo4j's own release. They talk about similar systems like CosmoDB and Neptune, which were introduced earlier than Neo4j. So the key point here is the first file, which clearly states that Neo4j was created in 2011.

Therefore, I can confidently say that Neo4j's graph query language was invented in 2011.
