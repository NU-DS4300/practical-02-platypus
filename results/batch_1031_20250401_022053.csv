Alright, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me read through each part carefully.

First, in the NoSQL Introduction section, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. That's a straightforward point right there.

Looking further into the Redis DB section on db-engines.com, they rank KV stores with a certain position. The number might relate to how many KV store services Redis supports. But I don't see any mention of MySQL or PostgreSQL in that context, so I can't assume those are included here.

In the Additional Information section under Redis + Python, it provides a simplified example about Redis using ML models. That's a specific use case but doesn't add more databases supported beyond the 16 mentioned earlier.

The last part discusses Redis as an in-memory database with durability options and mentions performance metrics like high transaction speed. It also gives some background on Redis's origin, which reinforces that it's designed to be efficient.

Putting this together, I can confidently say that Redis supports 16 databases by default.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the first section about Redis and its database count, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default numbered from 0 to 15. That's a clear number there. So I can note that down as one of the numbers: 16.

Next, in the second section, it talks about Redis being an open-source KV store. It mentions primary use cases like graph databases, spatial data, full-text search, vector spaces, and time-series data. But from what I know, that doesn't change the number of supported databases; it's just where they are used.

Then there's a section about Redis in Python using feature forms. It talks about Redis stores being ranked for KV stores as 18th out of 24. This again confirms the default count is 16 but doesn't add any more numbers.

The third part mentions Redis supporting in-memory operations, which isn't directly about the number of databases but explains why it's efficient. It also includes a simplified example on ML using Redis stores, which again doesn't change the database count.

Lastly, there's an entry from ""NoSQL - Redis: Durability of Data."" It talks about Redis being durability-first, supporting snapshots and append-only files for roll-forward. But this is more about design principles than the number of databases it supports.

So, putting all that together, I can confidently say that Redis supports 16 databases by default.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases as per its standard configuration. These are numbered from 0 to 15 and include various types such as graph, spatial, vector, time series, etc., but the count remains consistent.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. From the context provided, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases when used with db-engines.com. Each of these is numbered from 0 to 15.

Looking at the document links, page 22 talks about Redis offering 16 databases without any additional names. Page 17 then describes Redis as a data structure store that supports KV (Key-Value) interactions and other models like graph, spatial, etc., but it also mentions durability aspects: saving snapshots to disk or being append-only with a journal for roll-forward operations.

Page 18 highlights that Redis is an in-memory database system with durability features. It was developed in C++ and is known for being fast, handling up to 100,000 SET operations per second. The document also provides a link to madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/, which I believe might be related to Redis as a feature store.

Putting it all together, the first part of the context explicitly states that there are 16 default databases supported by Redis when using db-engines.com. Even though Redis can be used in other contexts with different libraries or models like MongoDB, the primary point here is about the number of base databases it offers.

Redis supports a total of 16 default databases when using db-engines.com. Each database is numbered from 0 to 15. This is the primary focus based on the provided context.
