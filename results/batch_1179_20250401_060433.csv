Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for its values. From the context provided, I can see that there are some sections discussing Redis Data Types and String Commands in Python. 

Looking at the first source, ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" it mentions that values in Redis can be strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data with similarity. That's helpful but I'm not sure how to translate that into actual data types used in Redis.

The second section is from the ""Redis + Python.pdf"" document, specifically pages 5-6 where there are examples of using mset and mget commands. For instance, mset({'key1': 'val1', 'key2': 'val2', 'key3': 'val3'}) creates a map-like structure. Then, mget is used to retrieve values, which returns them as lists or strings. This makes me think that while the theoretical types include strings and others like sets, Redis often uses more structured data structures for internal storage.

In page 4 of the same document, there are commands using r.set and r.incr. The examples show setting a key with a value and incrementing it. So, the actual values stored in Redis are strings or other types that can be assigned to keys.

Page 12 further explains how these values can be used, which reinforces the idea that they're not just simple strings but have more structured support for certain data types.

In the source linked at line 13, it's about Redis in context and DS/ML. The example uses r.get with a path to retrieve a value associated with 'clickCount' and increments it. This shows that even though the values are strings or other simple types, they're stored as such internally.

Looking back at the provided query: ""Name the data types supported by Redis for values."" I think I should list out the theoretical possibilities from the first source, but since the actual storage in Redis doesn't use those structures directly, maybe it's more about how to represent them. However, based on the Python examples, the primary supported data types for values are strings, lists, sets, hashes, and geospatial data.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if Redis strictly supports these theoretical types or only uses specific implementations like maps for sets or something else. For instance, does it use regular strings as keys in the map structure, which could be represented as a list of key-value pairs?

I think it's more about how to query and retrieve values rather than using the theoretical data types. So perhaps the primary data types Redis supports are strings and sequences (like lists, sets), with specific commands for each operation.

Putting it all together, I believe Redis primarily supports strings, lists, sets, hashes, and geospatial data as its value types, even though internally they're managed in a more structured manner. The examples provided in the document align with this understanding.

Redis primarily supports several key data types for storing values:

1. **Strings**: These are used to store text, numbers, etc., as simple sequences.
2. **Sets**: Implemented using regular sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements.
3. **Hashes (Mappings)**: Although Redis doesn't use plain hashes, it allows for key-value pairs where keys can be strings or other types.
4. **Geospatial Data**: Supports geospatial data with similarity types, such as strings containing latitude and longitude values.

These data types are used internally in Redis to manage collections efficiently, leveraging structured storage through features like maps (sets) for unsorted key-value pairs."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out the data types supported by Redis for storing values. Let me think about this step by step.

First, from what I know, Redis has a specific model of how it stores data in key-value pairs. It's different from traditional databases like MySQL or MongoDB. In Redis, everything is stored as a string, and you can have lists, sets, and other structures using keywords like mset, mget, set, etc.

The context provided gives me some information about Redis Data Types. The first chunk mentions that values in Redis are typically strings but can also be binary sequences. So, I'm guessing strings are the main data type for individual values, but there's more to it.

Looking at the other chunks, they talk about specific commands and outputs. For example, using mset creates key-value pairs where one side is a string. Mget retrieves all key-value pairs and flattens them into a list of unique values. Set adds elements to a list or set, but sets can't have duplicates because they're unique unsorted strings. In the command example, after setting 'clickCount:/abc' with 0, taking 'clickCount:/abc' gives the current count as a string.

The third chunk shows an example where mset is used to add multiple entries and then mget retrieves them into a list. The fourth chunk has another example with a set: r.set('key', value), r.get() returns all unique values from the set. So sets are key-value pairs with unique keys.

From the source link, it mentions that Redis Data/DS/ML uses feature stores to manage values efficiently for machine learning models. In this context, they might be using more complex structures like lists and sets as features.

Putting this together: Redis supports strings (the primary data type), lists, sets, and also hashes. When you use mset, you can store multiple items; mget returns all unique values; set adds items with no duplicates; and the list keyword is used for sequences. For more complex structures like feature stores in ML, they might use tuples or other array-like structures.

I should make sure I cover strings, lists, sets, hashes, and any other specific types mentioned or implied by the context.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for storing values include:

1. **Strings**: The primary type used for most individual values.
2. **Lists**: Achieved using the `mset` command to store multiple key-value pairs, which can be retrieved as a list of unique values.
3. **Sets**: Implemented using `r.set(key, value)` and `r.get('key')`, which returns all unique values from the set in a list.
4. **Hashes (Maphashes)**: Using `r.mset` to store key-value pairs where keys are hashes, and `r.get('hash_key')` retrieves the associated value as a hash or string.

Additional structures for feature stores in ML may include tuples or arrays, which can be built using commands like `mset`, but these would typically return strings."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for their values. Let me see... I remember that Redis uses a specific naming convention for its data types and operations. From what I recall, they use camel case or snake case with prefixes like 'm' for multisets or sets.

Looking back at the context provided, there's some information about Redis data types in two PDFs: one explaining the structure of Redis data types and another showing examples of string commands. In the first PDF, it mentions that values can be strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are functions), and geospatial data with similarity. The second PDF has some Python examples where they use 'mset' for multisets and 'mget', 'minc', etc., which all have a prefix of 'm'.

So putting that together, it looks like Redis supports camelCase names by default, but sometimes they switch to snake_case in certain contexts, especially when dealing with operations. The prefixes are usually lowercase letters starting from 'm', so maybe other languages or environments use different prefixes?

Wait, the query is specifically about naming data types for values, which probably doesn't include operations like mset or mget because those are more about storing and retrieving data rather than defining types. So I should focus on the actual type names that represent the data types themselves.

From the examples in the second PDF, when they do r.set(), it's 'clickCount:/abc', then use mget, minc, etc. The 'set' is a key-value storage, so maybe the underlying value (like clickCount) has its own data type name. In the context given, under the NoSQL section in the first PDF, they mention that values can be strings, lists, sets, etc., but not specific names beyond their types.

Wait, actually, I think the key thing here is to refer back to how Redis stores and retrieves data. The keys themselves have their own naming conventions. For example, if a key is ""clickCount:/abc"", then 'clickCount' is likely a separate key with its own type name. But in the context provided, it's just giving an example of using mget on that key.

So maybe when they talk about data types supported by Redis for values, they mean the keys used to store those values. So if 'clickCount:/abc' is a key, then 'clickCount' might have its own type name, but in this case, it's not being named here. Alternatively, the key could be any binary sequence, so maybe the types are just general strings unless specified otherwise.

Wait, no— Redis allows for both string keys and other data types as well. For example, you can use numbers or booleans as keys. So perhaps they don't have a specific name beyond what's necessary to denote it as a key. 

Alternatively, thinking about the command examples: r.set(‘key1’: ‘val1’, ...), where 'key1' is a string and 'val1' is a value type. But in the context given, the values are just described as strings, lists, etc., but not named individually.

So maybe when they ask for data types supported by Redis for values, it's about recognizing that any binary sequence can be used as a key, so the value types are just binary sequences unless specified otherwise. So names like ""string"", ""list"", etc., are the only ones discussed in the context provided.

But wait, in the first PDF, under 'Values', they list ""Strings (values)"", ""Lists (linked lists)"", ""Sets (unique unsorted string elements)"", etc. But these are more about what types of values you can have, not necessarily names.

So perhaps the answer is that Redis supports various binary sequences as key-value pairs, but the value types themselves don't have specific names beyond being any binary sequence unless specified. However, in practice, commands like mset use keywords with camelCase prefixes for clarity and consistency across operations.

But if I were to name data types supported by Redis for values, it's probably better to focus on the key-value pairs where each key is a unique identifier, so perhaps the data type names are just binary sequences, which aren't named unless they have specific identifiers. So maybe there isn't a standard naming convention for their value types beyond what's used in commands.

Alternatively, thinking about how keys and values are handled: when you store data in Redis, it's done by key-value pairs where the key is any identifier (like strings, numbers) and the value is whatever it holds. So the 'value' type isn't directly named; instead, it's determined by what each value actually contains.

But perhaps within Redis, to explicitly name the types used for values, we can think of them as being able to handle different data types: strings, lists, sets, etc., but without specific names beyond their content. So in that sense, I might say Redis supports various binary sequences (keys) with different value types, which aren't named individually unless specified.

Alternatively, thinking about the context provided, the numbers 1 and 2 are used as keys for storing data in a list. But again, these are specific to the example given, not general names for all possible values.

So maybe the best way to answer is that Redis supports binary sequences (keys) with value types that include strings, lists, sets, etc., but without specific naming beyond the examples provided. So when someone asks about data types supported by Redis for values, they're essentially asking about the content type of each key-value pair.

But wait, in the first PDF, under 'Values', it's clear that the value can be any binary sequence (string) or other types like lists, sets, etc., but without a specific name. So perhaps the answer is that Redis supports all possible binary sequences for keys and values as long as they are defined appropriately.

Alternatively, considering that in many languages, data types are named explicitly, perhaps in this context, the user wants names of the value types—like what each 'val' or 'list_val' is called. But from the context provided, I don't see any specific naming conventions beyond what's used in commands like mset.

So putting it all together, if someone asks for data types supported by Redis for values, the answer would be that they can hold any binary sequence (like strings) and other structured data types as keys. The value type isn't named individually; instead, the specific content of each value is defined when you store them.
</think>

Redis supports various binary sequences as key-value pairs where the key is an identifier (any unique entity), and the value can be a string or other types like lists, sets, hashes, etc. Each value's type isn't named individually; instead, it's determined by its content. 

Answer: Redis supports binary sequences (keys) with value types that include strings, lists, sets, etc., but without specific naming beyond their examples provided in commands.

Answer: Redis supports various binary sequences as keys, and the value type isn't named individually; instead, each value is defined based on what it contains."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
