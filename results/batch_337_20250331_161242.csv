Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant part step by step.

First, looking at the section about Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default. This is a direct statement, which tells me that Redis is set up with 16 databases named from 0 to 15. So that's 16 in total.

Then there's another part about Redis being an in-memory database system, but it's not just for KV stores; it can handle other data models like graphs and text. However, the first part is more concrete and clearly states that Redis has 16 databases by default. The second part doesn't add to the count of the number of databases Redis supports because it’s talking about different use cases beyond the basic setup.

The next section mentions Redis DB from db-engines.com, ranking KV stores higher. This reinforces the idea that Redis is primarily a KV store but can be used with various other models. Still, this doesn't change the fact that Redis has 16 databases in its default configuration.

There's another mention about Redis-py being the Python client for Redis, created by the company itself. The context here just provides setup instructions and mentions dependencies like Conda. It doesn't add to the number of supported databases; it's more about the tools used with Redis.

So, putting this all together, the key information is that Redis supports 16 databases in its default configuration. Even though there are other features or uses for Redis beyond being a KV store, those don’t change the count of databases it inherently supports.

Redis supports 16 databases by default as per the provided context.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant section one by one.

Starting from the first PDF, ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" page 22: It mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. Each has a unique name, but they don't seem to be given here. So I can note that there are 16 distinct database services.

Next, the second PDF, ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" page 23: It continues about Redis as an in-memory database system and its durability features. The main point is the number of databases it supports, which was just mentioned earlier as 16. I should look for any other mentions but don't see others.

The third PDF, ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf,"" page 2: It talks about Redis-py being the standard client for Python. There's no mention of additional databases here; it's more about how to connect to Redis in Python and some example use cases. So I don't get any new info from this PDF.

Further down, ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf,"" page 11: It discusses Redis Pipelines. Not related to database support but shows how to use Redis data stores with pipelining.

The fourth PDF, ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf,"" page 13: It gives a source on the three common architectures of Redis, which are in NoSQL, ActiveDB, and Webless. These are all components that build upon Redis as a database but aren't directly about how many databases Redis supports.

Another section from ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf,"" page 4: It explains string commands using Redis commands like hset, hgetall, etc., which again doesn't provide the number of databases.

Finally, ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" page 19: It lists Redis Data Types and Keys, noting that they can be any binary sequence. This is more about how data is stored than the count of supported databases.

Putting it all together, the only section that directly addresses the number of databases Redis supports is the first one. It mentions 16 databases numbered 0 to 15 without their names listed. Since I don't have further info on specific database names beyond numbering, it's safe to conclude that Redis supports 16 distinct databases.

The context indicates that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15, each with a unique name but not specified in the provided text. Therefore, the answer is:

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant section step by step.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro"" file (page 22), it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. There's no other name associated with them. This is a key point because it directly answers part of my question about the number of databases Redis supports.

Looking at another section titled ""Redis DB"" (page 17), I see that Redis is primarily described as a KV store but can be used with various models like graphs, text search, vector data, etc. However, this doesn't change the fact that it's still supporting the default 16 databases. So even though it mentions other use cases for these databases, Redis itself remains consistent in offering them.

I don't see any other sections that mention Redis providing more than the default 16 databases. For example, when discussing connecting to the server and using Redis Pipelines (page 2), it's about how to interact with Redis via Python but doesn't add more information on the number of supported databases. Similarly, in other pages like ""Redis-py 2"" and ""Hash Commands,"" while they talk about commands and operations, they don't clarify that Redis still supports 16 default databases.

Therefore, combining all these points, it's clear that Redis is designed to support exactly 16 databases by default, making the answer straightforward.
