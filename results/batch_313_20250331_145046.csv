Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let's go through it step by step.

First, looking at the sections in the context:

From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22): It mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So there are 16 databases. 

Then another part of the same document on Redis DB: it says Redis is an open-source in-memory database and can support various models like KV store, graph, spatial, etc.

But the question specifically asks about how many databases Redis supports. The first source clearly states that Redis defaults to 16 databases. The second part talks about different database models but doesn't mention the number of supported databases beyond pointing out Redis's versatility in modeling data.

So, even though Redis can support multiple types of databases through its model, the count remains at 16 since that's the number it's primarily known for as a KV store.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

I see that in the NoSQL Introduction section of the PDF, it mentions Redis providing 16 databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15. The context also provides a chunk about Redis as an in-memory database system, which supports durability features—saving snapshots at specific intervals or using a journal for roll-forward if there's a failure. It mentions that Redis is open-source and can be very fast with operations like SET being done up to 100,000 times per second.

Looking through the sections about RedisDB, it says Redis DB supports various models like KV store, graph, spatial, etc., but from the context, I don't see any mention of additional databases beyond the 16 numbered ones. There's a section on how Redis is used with Python in another PDF, which mentions that Redis-py is maintained by the company and provides these 16 databases.

So, putting it all together, Redis supports exactly 16 databases, each identified by a number from 0 to 15.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" document at page 22, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. So that's a clear starting point—redis supports 16 databases. 

Looking further down, on page 23, it talks about direct interaction with Redis using commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs. The context says there are no other names associated besides the numbers. Then, on page 24, it mentions Redis is an in-memory database system but supports durability features like saving snapshots to disk or being append-only.

In the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" document at page 17, it clarifies that Redis is primarily a KV store but can be used with other models. On page 20, it lists Redis DB as part of its collection: KV store, graph, spatial, full text search, vector, time series. However, the count for default databases remains 16.

Additionally, in ""Redis + Python.pdf"" at pages 1-3, it explains that Redis-py is a Python client library and supports multiple database types, but doesn't change the number of default databases Redis provides. The focus there is on connection details and how to use Redis-py with containers using Docker.

The overall context consistently states that Redis defaults to supporting 16 databases, numbered 0 through 15. Other mentions about durability features or extended data models don't affect the count of supported databases.
