Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the context mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases. They are numbered from 0 to 15. So, that's straightforwardâ€”numbered from 0 to 15 make it 16 in total.

Wait, does that mean each number corresponds to a specific database name? I think so. So each number is associated with a unique database instance in Redis. That makes sense because they're referred to as k/v pairs, which are used for parallel storage and transaction management.

The context also says that direct interaction with Redis uses commands related to setting and getting these k/v pairs. That gives me more context about how you access Redis data, but it doesn't change the number of databases supported.

There's no mention of other libraries or languages mentioned in this section, so I can focus solely on the information given here. The query is asking for the number of supported databases, which according to the context, is 16.

I don't see any other details from the context that could affect this answer, like mentioning different configurations or variations beyond the default numbering. So, sticking with what's provided seems safe.

Redis provides 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15, each associated with a unique database instance.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From what I remember in my studies, Redis is a pretty big database, especially known for its in-memory storage and the ability to work with other data sources through APIs. The context provided mentions that Redis has 16 default databases when you start using it.

Hmm, let me think again. Redis by default has 0 to 15 as its numbered range. So 0 is first, then 1, up until 15, right? That makes 16 in total because both 0 and 15 are included. I don't think there's any other name associated with them besides the number. 

I've heard that Redis can be connected to multiple languages and has various libraries for different operations. But regardless of those interactions, the default count is definitely 16 from 0 to 15. So yes, Redis supports exactly 16 databases by default.

Redis supports a total of **16 databases** by default when you start using it. These are numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me read through it again.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. So that's 16 in total. The context also refers to a chunk number as 23, which doesn't seem directly relevant here unless there's more information about other databases mentioned.

Wait, the query is asking how many databases Redis supports. It seems like it's a straightforward count of these numbered ones. Since they're numbered from 0 to 15, that's 16 different databases. I don't see any mention of additional libraries or names beyond those 16, so I think the answer should be 16.

I might be missing something because the query doesn't provide more details about Redis or other related databases. Maybe there are some specific terms or variations mentioned elsewhere that could imply a different number? But based on what's provided here, it's definitely numbered from 0 to 15, so 16 in total.
