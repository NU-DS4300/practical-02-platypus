Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about the data types supported by Redis for values and has provided a context that seems to include information from a PDF on Redis, specifically pages 19, 18, and 22, among others.

First, I need to identify which parts of the context mention Redis's data types. Scanning through the text, I see mentions like ""Redis Data Types Keys"" on page 19, where it lists strings as values, lists, sets, sorted sets, and geospatial data with similarity. Then on page 22, it talks about Redis databases and interaction commands.

Wait, but the query is only about data types for values, so I should focus on that section. The text on page 19 specifically addresses data types and their values, which aligns perfectly with what's needed.

I also need to consider if there are any other mentions in the context related to this topic. On page 23, it discusses Redis as a client for Python but doesn't directly address the data types themselves. So, I'll stick to the information on Redis Data Types Keys for values.

It's important to ensure accuracy here since the query is about values, not structures or objects. The context does mention strings being a common value type in Redis, which fits well with the query's focus.

In summary, the key points are:
1. Redis supports various data types as keys and values.
2. Strings are one of the primary value types discussed.
3. Lists, sets, and hashes (including geospatial data) are other significant types mentioned.

I should present these points clearly to answer the user's query accurately based on the provided context.
</think>

The Redis database supports various data types for both keys and values. Here is a summary of the primary data types mentioned:

- **Strings**: One of the most common value types in Redis, as strings are versatile and widely used.
- **Lists**: A list is an ordered collection of elements that can contain duplicates. It implements a linked list structure.
- **Sets**: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is efficient for membership testing.
- **Sorted Sets**: A sorted set maintains its elements in a specific order, which allows for binary search operations.
- **Hashes (Hash Tables)**: Each key-value pair maps to a hash value, providing fast lookup and insertion times.
- **Geospatial Data 20**: Geospatial data with similarity can be stored as strings representing coordinates.

These are the primary data types supported by Redis for values."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for its values based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.

The first section mentions Redis as an in-memory database system that's considered robust and fast, supporting durability features like saving snapshots or append-only files which can be rolled forward. It also talks about Redis being open-source and having various commands but not handling complex data well. The page 19 chunk lists the Redis Database Data Types Keys with details on their values.

Looking at that, it says:
- Values: Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial data with similarity 0.31
- Hashes (string â†’ string) with similarity 0.35

But the context also includes other parts that discuss Redis as a KV store but can be used in different models like Graph, Spatial, etc., and mentions it's an open-source project maintained by Redis.

The second section introduces Redis-py, which is the Python client for Redis. It notes that Redis is open-source and maintained by the company itself. Also, it provides information about using Redis with Conda and other tools.

Wait, but none of these sections explicitly mention all the data types Redis supports beyond what's in page 19. The section on Redis-py just mentions maintaining Redis as an open-source project and providing a Python client. It doesn't list the specific data types it supports for values. The earlier part discusses Redis's database features but not its data types.

So, considering all this, I don't have explicit information about what data types Redis directly supports for its values from the given context. The sections talk about keys in the DB chunk and Redis-py, which is a client, but that doesn't add data type info on its own.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can't name the data types Redis supports for values. It seems like the information is more about how it's used with other models or as a database system than the specific data types.
</think>

The provided context does not explicitly list the data types Redis supports for its values. However, Redis can handle various data types depending on the model (e.g., KV store vs. Graph, Spatial) and can be used in conjunction with language libraries. The section on Redis-py mentions it's a client for Python but doesn't provide specific data type details.

Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the query about the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context. Let me go through each section of the text to find relevant information.

First, looking at page 19, which mentions Redis Data Types Keys. It lists several keys like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and geospatial data with similarity metrics. The question is about values, so I should focus on what's supported for storage.

Page 18 talks about Redis being an in-memory database that supports durability of data through snapshots or append-only files. It mentions being developed in C++ and can be very fast, up to 100,000 operations per second. However, this is more about functionality than the actual values supported for storage.

Page 17 discusses Redis as a KV store but also supports other models like graphs, spatial, etc., which it can be used with. It provides a ranking of KV stores, mentioning that Redis falls in the first group. But again, it doesn't specify what data types are stored.

Looking at pages 22 and 23, Redis has multiple databases by default (0 to 15) and mentions direct interaction through commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs. There's also a mention of Python as the client library. This information is about how to interact with Redis in Python but doesn't list the data types used.

Finally, pages 24 onwards discuss Redis-py on GitHub, mentioning pip install redis for the environment, but that's more about setup than specifying supported values.

Putting it all together, the context seems to mention Redis supporting various data structures as keys (like strings, lists, sets) in its Data Types Keys section. However, it doesn't specify which specific data types are stored or used. Therefore, I can't confidently name all the data types Redis supports for storage without further details.
</think>

The provided context does not explicitly list all the data types supported by Redis for values. However, Redis primarily supports string types in its Data Types Keys section, which include various structures like strings, lists (which are unsorted sequences), sets (unique elements), and more specialized types such as geospatial data. For direct interaction and specific key-value storage operations, Redis uses a KV store model, allowing for lookups by key type. The focus on durability methods in the context does not specify the exact values stored. Therefore, while Redis can handle string-based keys, other data types may be supported through different structures or models.

Answer: Redis primarily supports string and related data types as keys (e.g., strings, lists, sets) for storage, but it uses a KV store model allowing for lookups by key type without specifying all possible data types."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
