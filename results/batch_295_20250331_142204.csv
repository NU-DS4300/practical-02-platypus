Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It says there are no other names associated with them and that direct interaction is done through specific commands for setting and getting k/v pairs. Additionally, it lists a variety of language libraries available as well. 

So, the main point here is that Redis has these 16 databases by default. Each database is assigned a unique number from 0 to 15. The context doesn't mention any limitations or additional services beyond these 16.

I should double-check if there's anything else mentioned about Redis besides the 16 databases. It says ""Direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs,"" which suggests that these are the core functionalities but doesn't add more databases. The part about 23 seems out of context or perhaps was a typo.

Therefore, based on the provided information, Redis supports exactly 16 databases. There's no indication that there are more services or libraries beyond those defaults.

Redis supports exactly 16 default databases. These are numbered from 0 to 15 and come as part of the core functionality without any additional services or libraries beyond these defaults.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. The context provided from the document mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It also says there are no other names associated with them and that they can be interacted with using specific commands related to k/v pairs or variations.

So, if I take that at face value, Redis supports 16 databases. That includes all the numbers from 0 up to 15 without any additional naming conventions beyond their numbering. Therefore, the answer should be 16.

Redis provides 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through it again.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. There's no other name associated with them besides their numbers. It also talks about direct interaction using commands related to k/v pairs and varies in some way, which I think means they have multiple types of interactionsâ€”like up-to-date or latest.

The query is specifically asking how many databases Redis supports. So the answer is straightforward from the context: 16.

Wait, does that include all possible numbers? The numbers go from 0 to 15, making it sixteen in total. That seems correct.

Relevant to the query:

From the context provided, the number of supported databases in Redis is listed as 16, numbered from 0 to 15.

Answer: Redis supports 16 databases by default, each numbered from 0 to 15."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
