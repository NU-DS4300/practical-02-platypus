Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which means operations like search and insert can be done in O(log n) time. The balance is crucial to prevent the worst-case scenario where the tree could become a linked list, leading to O(n) time for those operations.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree occur when this property isn't maintained. There are two main types of imbalances: one on the left and one on the right side of a node. These imbalances can cause rotations during insertion or deletion to maintain balance.

I remember that when inserting a new element, if it causes the height difference between the two child subtrees to be more than one, we need to perform rotations. Similarly, when deleting an element, if the parent has only one child but that becomes taller than its left sibling, another rotation is needed.

From the context provided, I see mentions of ""Non-Repeatable Read"" (Isolation) and ""Monotonic Read Consistency."" These are related to database replication but don't directly address AVL tree imbalances. The chunks about replication Lag involve synchronization issues in databases, which aren't relevant here.

Looking back at the query: What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations? I think it's about specific types of unbalance that need more than one rotation to fix. For example, if inserting a new node causes the left subtree to be two levels deeper than the right, or vice versa.

Also, when deleting an element, certain conditions can cause the tree to become imbalanced. If the parent node has only one child but needs to split to maintain balance, that's another case where multiple rotations are needed.

I also recall that when a node is inserted such that its parent becomes unbalanced, we might need two rotations: one upward if it's the leftmost node and another downward if it's the rightmost. Similarly, in deletion cases, especially for elements near the bottom of a leaf, the tree may become unbalanced.

Wait, I think when inserting causes the height difference to be two, you first move down from the insertion point (like moving up one level) which might fix some imbalance but still have another level off. Then, when moving back up, that fixes it by rotating upwards once. So that's two rotations for this case.

In deletion cases, if a node has only one child and needs to be split, you first move the existing node down (like moving left or right depending on which side is taller) and then move the parent up, causing another rotation.

So, both insertion where it creates an imbalance on the left or right subtree, and deletion when the node's parent is one level off, require two rotations each to restore balance.

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations are specific cases where the tree becomes unbalanced. These include:

1. **Insertion causing a height difference of two**: When inserting a new element causes the left or right subtree height difference to exceed one, balancing is achieved by first moving down and then up, requiring two rotations.

2. **Deletion leading to an imbalance**: If deleting an element results in a node with only one child but needing rebalancing due to its parent being too tall, another rotation is needed after adjusting the parent.

In both cases, multiple rotations are necessary to restore balance and ensure efficient operations."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees.

An AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which helps maintain efficient operations like searching and inserting.

I remember that imbalances in an AVL tree can occur when the balance factor (the difference between the heights of the left and right subtree) is more than 1 or less than -1. These imbalances lead to rotations to rebalance the tree.

Now, I think about the two common types of rotations: single rotation for right-heavy trees and double rotation for left-heavy trees. But wait, the query is asking specifically about multiple rotations, so maybe it's not just one type but a combination or specific scenario.

Let me visualize an AVL tree that's unbalanced. Suppose there's a node where the right child has been accessed more frequently than the left. This imbalance would cause the right subtree to be taller than the left, leading to what's called a ""right-heavy"" tree.

In such cases, when inserting or updating data in the right subtree, if not handled correctly, it might cause an imbalance. If I insert into the right child and the balance isn't maintained, the rotation needed is for the node's parent upwards until the balance condition is restored.

Wait, but sometimes a single insertion can cause multiple rotations because each rotation may shift the tree in different directions. For example, when balancing a node that requires both left and right rotations to restore balance, it might take two steps.

Alternatively, if a specific insertion leads to more than one level of imbalance, perhaps at deeper levels, then each level could require individual rotations until everything balances out.

I should check if I'm considering all possible scenarios. Is there a case where multiple rotations are needed beyond just single or double? Maybe when the tree is rebalanced by rotating up through several nodes, each requiring their own rotation step.

Yes, that makes sense. Each level of imbalance could necessitate a rotation, either to the left or right, depending on whether it's a right-heavy or left-heavy situation at that node. So, in such cases, multiple rotations are needed.

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when the tree is unbalanced due to excess height differences in specific subtrees. When accessing data in the subtree with higher height, the balance factor exceeds the allowed range (Â±1). This imbalance necessitates rebalancing by rotating up through the tree's nodes until all levels are balanced. Each rotation adjusts the heights of the affected nodes to maintain the AVL property, requiring multiple individual rotations for deeper imbalances.

**Answer:**  
Multiple rotations in an AVL tree occur when inserting or accessing data in a subtree that is significantly taller than its counterpart, leading to unbalanced height differences. To rebalance such subtrees, multiple single or double rotations may be needed, rotating up through the affected nodes until all levels are balanced."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, let's try to figure out the answer to this query about AVL trees. I'm not super familiar with AVL trees from scratch, but I remember they're related to data structures and maybe balancing operations. The user asked, ""What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?"" 

First, I'll break down what I know. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This means that it always maintains balance, which helps to keep operations like insertion and deletion efficient.

So, if an AVL tree isn't balanced properly, there will be imbalances in its structure. I think this imbalance can cause some issues because without proper balancing, the tree might become skewed, leading to inefficient operations or performance drops.

The query is specifically asking about when multiple rotations are needed. Rotations in a BST context usually refer to rotating nodes around their parent to maintain balance. I remember that one rotation is enough when the tree becomes slightly unbalanced, like a single node imbalance. But what happens when there's more than one such imbalance?

I recall something about ""case 1"" and ""case 2."" In case 1, the height difference between two child subtrees of a parent node is only one. This means that the left subtree is exactly one level taller than the right or vice versa. Rotating around this point (like moving a node up) would fix it with a single rotation.

But what happens if there's more imbalance? That is, when the height difference between two child subtrees is more than one? I think this requires multiple rotations. For example, if the left subtree is two levels taller than the right, you might need to perform several rotations. Each time you adjust one side, you have to fix it by rotating another part of the tree.

So, putting it together, when an AVL tree has imbalances beyond just a single node difference, multiple rotations are needed. The user probably wants to understand why sometimes more than one rotation is necessary and how that works in maintaining balance.

The query asks about imbalances in an AVL tree requiring multiple rotations. An AVL tree ensures balance by keeping the heights of child subtrees differing by at most one. In case of unbalanced imbalances, such as a node causing two levels difference, single rotations fix it (case 1). However, more imbalances require multiple rotations (case 2), where each rotation adjusts another part of the tree to maintain balance."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
