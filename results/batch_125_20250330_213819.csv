Alright, let me break this down step by step. The user is asking about the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context.

First, I'll look through each chunk in the context to find relevant information. 

- From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 19), it mentions that Redis supports strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes as values.
- The same page also talks about Redis being an in-memory system with durability options but doesn't delve into the number of supported data types beyond what's mentioned.

Next, I check other related sections for additional info. The ""NoSQL Intro"" section from 05 seems to cover Redis basics, while the ""Redis + Python.pdf"" page lists Redis commands and mentions its speed. However, it doesn't explicitly state how many data types Redis can handle in depth.

I also consider whether any other context is relevant but don't find anything that contradicts what's already mentioned or adds more details on supported data types.

So, consolidating the information from the provided sections: Redis supports strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. It doesn't specify if it handles complex data beyond these, so I stick to those.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

1. **Strings**: These can be any binary sequence.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: These support unsorted string elements.
3. **Sets (Unsorted Strings)**: These store unique, unsorted strings.
4. **Sorted Sets**: These allow sorted and unique data structures.
5. **Hashes (Key-Value Pairs)**: These map keys to values using strings.

These types are fundamental for many operations in Redis, such as key-value storage and lookups."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports as values. Let me look through the context provided.

First, in the NoSQL Intro section, there's a chunk that mentions ""Values: - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets (unique unsorted string elements) - Sorted Sets - Hashes (string â†’ string) - Geospatial data."" So Redis does support strings for values, which are used in many contexts like keys or identifiers.

Then, the NoSQL Intro page has a chunk about Redis being an open-source, in-memory database. It mentions that it's designed to be fast and supports durability of data by saving snapshots and append-only files. This could mean that there might be some limitations when working with certain types of data because of how Redis handles changes.

Looking at the section about Redis as a Python client, it says ""Redis-py is the standard client for Python."" It also mentions it's maintained by the Redis Company itself and lists 16 databases. The context doesn't explicitly mention any specific data types, but based on previous knowledge, I know that while Redis is primarily used for in-memory data storage, it can handle certain complex operations which might require more structured data models.

In the section about connecting a data source with Redis using DataGrip, it suggests giving a name to the data source and configuring the port. This makes me think about how you define keys or keys-value pairs, but I'm not sure if this relates directly to the data types supported as values.

The ""Connecting from DataGrip"" section also provides instructions on setting up Redis connections, which is more about configuration rather than specific data types.

The other sections mention that Redis supports various structures like KV store, graph, spatial, etc., but they don't list any specific data types beyond strings in many cases. There's a mention of hashes and sets, which are related to data storage as well.

Putting this together, I think the primary data types Redis is known for using values are strings because it's intended for in-memory data storage and processing. However, when used with other data models or structures, there might be specific commands that require particular keys or objects as keys, which aren't covered in the context provided.

So, summarizing my thoughts: Redis primarily supports string values due to its design for in-memory databases, but it's versatile enough to handle more complex operations involving structured data. The exact list of data types supported as values isn't explicitly detailed beyond the examples given in the context.
</think>

The primary data type Redis supports as values is **string**. While Redis is designed for in-memory storage and can handle other structures like sets, lists, hashes, etc., its core focus is on string-based key-value pairs. However, it's versatile enough to support various operations when used with different data models or structures, though the exact list of specific data types isn't explicitly detailed in the provided context beyond the examples given.

Answer: Redis primarily supports **strings** as values due to its in-memory design and intended use for efficient key-value storage."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for their values. Let me start by looking through the context provided.

First, in the NoSQL Introduction section, it mentions that Redis supports various data types like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. It also talks about geospatial data but doesn't mention names there. 

In the NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 19), it describes Redis as an in-memory database system with durability features. It mentions that Redis supports lookups by key only, without secondary indexes, which is a bit confusing because other databases might support more types of indexing.

Looking further down, there are chunks about connecting data sources to Redis and some string commands like mset, mget, set, and incr. These seem to be related to managing collections or sets of items. So while it doesn't explicitly name the primary data types, it does describe how certain operations work with collections, which could imply that they have similar functionalities to other languages in terms of data handling.

In Redis + Python.pdf (page 3), there's a section on string commands where mget and incr are used for manipulating sets. This suggests that Redis supports operations like mset and mget, which are probably the primary data types or specific structures in Redis related to collections.

So, putting it all together, even though Redis doesn't explicitly name its data types, it's clear from other sources that it can manage various collections through commands like mset (to add elements), mget (to retrieve elements by key), set (another way of adding elements with keys), and incr (to increment counts). These seem to indicate the presence of different types of data structures or collection types within Redis.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for their values include:

1. **Strings**: Represented as strings, which can be used for various key-value operations.

2. **Sets**: Collections where each element is unique and can be retrieved individually using keys.

3. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Keys and values that can be any type, accessed via the hash key.

4. **Lists**: Ordered collections where you can add elements in sequence or retrieve all elements by key.

5. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain insertion order upon insertion.

6. **Geospatial Data**: Supports geospatial types with similarity 133.24.

These operations are facilitated through Redis' command language, which includes mset, mget, set, and incr, indicating the handling of various collection structures within Redis."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
