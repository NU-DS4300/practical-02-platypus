Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The user gave a few documents about Neo4j, including parts of ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" and others.

Looking through the context, the first document is ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher."" It says that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011. That seems to be the key piece of information I need for my answer.

The other documents discuss the introduction to Neo4j as a graph-based database, its features like ACID compliance, distributed computing support, and various indexing methods. However, they don't provide any specific dates related to the development or creation of the Cypher query language itself. They mention that it was created in 2011, which is probably when Neo4j's original graph query language, Cypher, was introduced.

Additionally, there are references to similar systems like Microsoft CosmoDB and Amazon Neptune, but these don't add any new dates about Neo4j's innovation date. The documents also talk about the introduction of certain algorithms in Neo4j but again, nothing more relevant to when Cypher was created specifically.

So, putting it all together, the query mentions the creation of Neo4j's graph query language, which isCypher, and according to the provided context, that was introduced in 2011. The other documents discuss the broader capabilities of Neo4j but not focus on when Cypher was created.

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented in 2011.

Answer: Cypher was introduced by Neo4j in 2011."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, it seems like there are a bunch of documents about Neo4j and its use in graph databases. But none of them directly mention ""graph query language."" Hmm.

Looking at the documents, some talk about Neo4j's query language being created in 2011. That makes sense because the name Neo4j comes from ""NoEdges 4 Junctions,"" which sounds like a place where edges meet, similar to how nodes connect in a graph. The Cypher language was introduced around that time and is meant for querying these graph structures.

Other documents mention that Neo4j supports ACID compliance and distributed computing but don't explicitly say when the graph query language itself was created. However, I know that Cypher is the query language used within Neo4j. So maybe the answer is tied to 2011 when Cypher for the graph was developed.

So, putting it all together, Neo4j's graph query language (Cypher) was invented in 2011, even though there are other documents that might not explicitly state this. But based on common knowledge and context, 2011 seems to be the right year.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was invented around 2011.

**Answer:** Neo4j's graph query language (Cypher) was invented in 2011."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j introduced its graph query language. From the context provided, there are several documents about Neo4j, but none directly mention the introduction of a specific query language like Cypher or APOC. The documents talk about the system as a whole—its architecture, data model, various plugins like APOC and the Graph Data Science plugin—which handle graph queries.

Looking at each document, I see that Neo4j's graph query features have been discussed in detail, including how it works with different databases and data models. However, none of them specifically mention the introduction of a particular query language such as Cypher or APOC. They do talk about these tools within Neo4j but don't explicitly state when Neo4j itself introduced its own graph query system.

Cypher is mentioned in one document as a ""Visual way of matching patterns and relationships (nodes)"" which suggests that it's part of the system, but it doesn't provide information on when it was introduced. Similarly, APOC is referred to as an ""Awesome Procedure"" under Neo4j, indicating it's an extension or plugin.

Therefore, based on the context provided, there isn't any document that explicitly states when Neo4j first introduced its graph query language. The introduction of such a language would be part of an underlying architecture or toolset, which Neo4j doesn't introduce as prominently as the system itself.

Neo4j does not explicitly state the introduction of its own graph query language within the provided context. The document mentions Cypher and APOC, which are extensions or tools for Neo4j, but it does not provide a timeline for Neo4j's own introduction of a graph query language.

**Answer:** Neo4j did not introduce its own graph query language as prominently asCypher and APOC. The query language introduced is Cypher, which operates within the system framework that includes plugins like APOC and the Graph Data Science plugin to handle graph queries."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
