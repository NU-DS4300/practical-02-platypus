Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, from page 22 of the NoSQL document, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases numbered 0 to 15. These are part of their suite of storage services. So that's a starting point—Redis supports 16 databases in total at the default level.

Then, looking at the next section on Redis DB and interacts, it goes into more detail about how Redis is used by developers, mentioning several data types like Strings, Lists, Sets, etc., but it doesn't directly answer the question. So that part isn't relevant for counting the number of supported databases.

There's also a discussion about Redis' durability aspects—appending-only files or saving snapshots at specific intervals—but again, this isn't related to database count. The section on ""Redis Data Types"" seems more about functionality than support numbers.

The paragraph on the ranking of KV stores mentions that Redis is ranked first among KV stores by volume but doesn't provide a number relevant here. It also clarifies that Redis is primarily a KV store but can be used for other models, which again isn't helpful for the question.

In the ""Redis - It is considered..."" section, it gives stats about performance, specifically how fast Redis can handle 100,000 SET operations per second. This info might help in understanding Redis' efficiency but doesn't affect the count of supported databases.

Finally, looking at the Python documentation on Redis with a Conda environment, it mentions that redis-py is the standard client for Python and is maintained by Redis itself. This section reinforces that Redis supports 16 databases.

Putting this all together: the main points are the 16 default databases mentioned in page 22, which directly answer the query about how many databases Redis supports. The other sections either discuss how Redis works, its durability features, or its usage outside of KV stores, but they don't add any additional information that affects counting the supported number.

So, after reviewing all the provided context, I can confidently say that Redis supports 16 databases in total.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

From the section about Redis, it mentions that there are 16 default databases. They're numbered from 0 to 15. That part is straightforward. So right away, I can count those numbers: 0,1,2,... up to 15. Let me see, how many numbers is that? If I start at 0 and go to 15 inclusive, that's 16 different numbers. So that gives me a starting point.

Then there are some more details about Redis in the context. It talks about it being an in-memory database system but also supports durability of data through snapshots and append-only files. These are about how Redis handles data persistence. But those details don't directly answer the question about the number of supported databases, so I can ignore them for now.

The section also mentions that Redis has many language libraries available as well. That's related to data processing but again, not the main focus here.

Looking further, in the Python section from the same context, it says that redis-py is the standard client for Python and that they're maintained by Redis themselves. It also provides a Conda environment setup, which might be useful if someone were to use Redis with Python in their development environment.

In the end, the query is asking how many databases Redis supports. The previous text did mention 16 databases numbered 0 to 15. So that seems to be the key answer here.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases, numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me start by looking through the information given.

First, I see that in the section about Redis Database and Interaction, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That seems straightforward— Redis's standard collection of database instances. The term ""default"" here probably refers to the primary ones that are included with the product or service.

Then, looking at the other parts, like the KDB document about Redis as a data structure store and its durability features, it doesn't mention any additional databases. It does talk about key-value stores but only mentions one database out of 16 in those sections. The section on Redis Data Types also lists various types but doesn't discuss multiple databases.

Additionally, there's a slide on Redis Command List where I see a list of commands, and it says to use the filter function to target specific data structures like list, hash, set, etc., and provides documentation for a complete list. This part is more about how you can interact with Redis through its API or library, but again, it doesn't mention multiple databases beyond the 16 mentioned in the first section.

Putting this together: The initial information directly states that Redis supports 16 default databases. Other sections don't add any additional information about multiple databases; they focus more on functionality within a single database instance rather than supporting multiple ones.

Based on the context provided, Redis supports 16 default databases. This is clearly stated in the section titled ""Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default."" The other sections discuss Redis as a data structure store, its durability features, key-value stores, and various data types but do not mention supporting multiple databases beyond the initial 16 mentioned.
