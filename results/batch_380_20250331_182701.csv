"I must politely say that the context you provided is not relevant to the query about AVL trees and rotations. The context appears to be discussing limitations and challenges of relational databases, while the query is asking about a specific data structure (AVL tree) and its rotation properties.

However, I'll do my best to answer the query regardless.

In an AVL tree, multiple rotations are required when there's an imbalance in the tree that cannot be resolved with a single rotation. Specifically:

* If the height of the left subtree is more than one greater than the height of the right subtree (or vice versa), it's called Left-Heavy or Right-Heavy. In this case, you need to perform a double rotation (left-left or right-right) to restore balance.
* If the imbalance is caused by an insertion or deletion operation that creates a skew in the tree, you may need to perform multiple rotations to rebalance the tree.

The types of imbalances that require multiple rotations include:

1. Left-heavy or right-heavy subtrees with a large height difference.
2. A chain of nodes on one side of the tree, causing the imbalance.
3. A node that has many children on one side, creating an imbalance.

In general, AVL trees are designed to maintain balance after insertion and deletion operations by performing rotations as needed. The goal is to minimize the number of nodes that need to be accessed during search or traversal operations."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"I must say that the context provided seems unrelated to the query about AVL trees. The query is asking about imbalances in an AVL tree requiring multiple rotations, which appears to be a question about data structures and algorithms.

However, I'll do my best to answer the query to the best of my ability, even though it's not directly related to the context provided.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most one. Imbalances in an AVL tree require rotations to restore balance. There are two types of imbalances:

1. Left-heavy imbalance: When the left subtree is taller than the right subtree.
2. Right-heavy imbalance: When the right subtree is taller than the left subtree.

To handle these imbalances, the following rotation types can be used:

* Left-Left (LL) or Left-Rotate-Right (LRR): For a left-heavy imbalance on the left side of the tree.
* Right-Right (RR) or Right-Rotate-Left (RRL): For a right-heavy imbalance on the right side of the tree.
* Left-Right (LR) or Right-Locate-Left (RLL): For a right-heavy imbalance on the left side of the tree.

In some cases, multiple rotations might be required to restore balance. This can happen when there are multiple consecutive imbalances in the same direction (e.g., multiple left-heavy imbalances). The AVL tree algorithm ensures that the number of nodes at each level remains relatively constant by performing these rotations as needed.

"I'm happy to help! However, I must say that the query ""What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?"" is not directly related to the context provided.

The context discusses the limitations and challenges of relational databases, while the query asks about AVL trees. While both topics are relevant to computer science and data engineering, they are distinct areas of study.

To answer the query as accurately as possible:

In an AVL tree, imbalances can occur when the height of one subtree differs significantly from the other. This imbalance requires rotations to restore balance and maintain the properties of the AVL tree (i.e., the height difference between left and right subtrees must be at most 1).

Multiple rotations are required in the following cases:

* Left-left (LL) or Right-right (RR) imbalances: In these cases, two consecutive rotations (either LL or RR) are necessary to restore balance.
* Left-right (LR) or Right-left (RL) imbalances: In these cases, a single rotation is sufficient.
