Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query about the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context has several sections from various files. In the first file, ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" it mentions Redis Data Types Keys. It lists keys like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and geospatial data with similarity 0.17. That seems relevant because it's talking about key types in Redis.

The second file is from ""Redis + Python.pdf"" on page 19, where it discusses the values supported by Redis objects. It says the values can be strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are strings to string mappings), and geospatial data with similarity 0.20.

Then there's another section from the same file that specifically talks about commands in Python using Redis, like mset, mget, set, get, incr, etc., again listing the types used there—strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data with similarity 0.25.

Another part is a note from page 13 that mentions Redis in Context 13, but it's somewhat vague without specific details on supported values. The next file is about Redis in context 14, but again, the content isn't provided here.

Looking at the last chunk, it seems to be converting JSON to strings using Python's redis module with a similar list of types and their similarities (0.29 for geospatial data).

Now, the query is asking specifically about the data types supported by Redis for values. From these sections, I can see that in the first part, they talk about keys being strings or other structures, but not directly about the values. The second file explicitly lists the values: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (strings to strings), and geospatial data.

The Python section also confirms this list of values—strings, lists, sets, etc., with similar confidence. There's no mention of other types like integers or booleans in any of these sections, so I don't need to consider those unless the query specifically asks about them.

Putting it all together, the data types Redis supports for values are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (strings to strings), and geospatial data. The context doesn't mention any other types like integers or booleans.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- Strings
- Lists (which can contain multiple elements)
- Sets (which contain unique, unsorted elements)
- Sorted Sets (which maintain order of insertion)
- Hashes (which are functions that map keys to string values)
- Geospatial data, which includes spatial information

 Redis supports these types of values in its objects and commands."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for their values. I'm not entirely sure about all the different types Redis has, but from what I've read in the context provided, it seems like Redis can store various kinds of data.

First, looking at the context, there are a couple of files mentioned. The first one is ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" which talks about Redis as a NoSQL database and mentions string types. Then there's another file titled ""Redis in Context 13"" which discusses how Redis works within different contexts like DS/ML and feature stores.

From the context, I see that Redis supports several data types for values. It lists strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. There's also a mention of using true converters to decode certain formats into strings.

I think these are all the main data types Redis can handle. So, I should list them out in order from what seems most basic to more complex: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and then geospatial data. The context also talks about how Redis is used in feature stores and other ML models, so maybe there's something else there too.

Wait, the file ""Redis + Python.pdf"" on page 4 has a section where it shows commands like set(), get(), incr(). So that means there are more operations beyond just simple data types. But when it comes to the basic values, I think those are the main ones Redis supports. 

So putting it all together, the supported data types for values in Redis are: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data.

The primary data types supported by Redis for storing values include:

1. **Strings**: Simple text or alphanumeric characters.
2. **Lists**: Ordered collections of items that can contain any binary sequences.
3. **Sets**: Unsorted unique elements from binary sequences.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but in a sorted order.
5. **Hashes**: Mapped keys to values, where the key is a binary sequence and the value is another binary sequence or text.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Data that includes geographical information, which can be represented as JSON strings containing coordinates.

These data types allow Redis to handle various kinds of data efficiently in different contexts."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the query about the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context.

First, I'll look through each section of the context to find mentions of Redis data types. 

In ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", page 19 says Redis Data Types Keys: - usually strings but can be any binary sequence Values: - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets (unique unsorted string elements) - Sorted Sets - Hashes (string → string) - Geospatial data 20) with similarity 106.03

Then, in ""Redis + Python.pdf"" page 5, there are examples of String Commands: r.set(‘clickCount:/abc’, 0), r.get(‘clickCount:/abc’), and r.incr(‘clickCount:/abc’) followed by retrieval. The example shows how sets can hold data which is then incremented. This supports the idea that Redis has sorted sets.

On page 14, there's a source linking Redis to Data Science/ML with DS/ML: https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/. It mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default and can be used for feature stores. This suggests Redis supports hashes which are useful in feature stores.

In the later sections, especially where data is stored as k/v pairs, like on page 23 with chunk Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default... – They discuss direct interaction through Redis commands, including mset for sets and hget for hashes. Similarly, hset is used in an example on page 9.

So putting this all together, Redis supports strings, lists, sets (both sorted and unsorted), hashes as functions mapping to strings, and geospatial data.
</think>

Redis supports several data types which are categorized based on their use cases and operations. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Strings**: The primary type for storing text, numbers, and other textual data.

2. **Lists**: These support appending elements but do not allow direct random access (like Python lists). They are useful for sequences where order matters.

3. **Sets**: Sets in Redis store unique elements. There are two types:
   - **Unsorted Sets**: Elements can be duplicated.
   - **Sorted Sets**: Elements are stored in a sorted order, allowing efficient operations like hgetall, which retrieves all keys in a sorted manner.

4. **Hashes**: Also known as key-value pairs, hashes store data using functions (keys) and return values. Redis supports this with various functions that can be used to map keys to values.

5. **Geospatial Data**: Redis can handle geospatial data for location-based services through specific keywords or functions related to coordinates and positions.

These data types enable Redis to be versatile in different contexts, from feature stores (as seen on page 14) where hashes are crucial for key-value storage, to other functionalities like sets, lists, and strings for handling various data structures."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
