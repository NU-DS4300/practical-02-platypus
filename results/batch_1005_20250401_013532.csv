Okay, so I need to answer the query about the data types supported by Redis for their values based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.

The context mentions that Redis supports several data types for values. It lists them as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. I also see a mention of geospatial data with specific similarity levels, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here since the query is about value types. 

Wait, the query specifically asks to name the data types supported by Redis for their values. The context does provide some information, but it seems to list them as strings, lists, sets, etc., without explicitly stating which are the primary value types used in practice.

I should check if there's an authoritative source that confirms which specific data types Redis primarily uses. Since I don't have access to external sources beyond what's provided, I might need to make educated guesses based on general knowledge and typical use cases of Redis.

Redis is known for handling large datasets efficiently, so it can manage various types of data. The supported value types include strings, which are versatile but can be any binary sequence. Lists are used for ordered collections, sets for unique elements (without order), sorted sets for ordered uniqueness, and hashes as keys. These types would be crucial when building distributed systems or handling big datasets.

I should structure my answer by first acknowledging the context provided, then listing each supported data type with a brief explanation of their use cases. This will help clarify that Redis primarily supports these value types but also note any exceptions if necessary.

The query asks to name the data types supported by Redis for their values. Based on the context, Redis primarily uses several key data types: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. These are essential for managing large datasets efficiently, as they allow for flexible data handling across various distributed systems and applications.

**Answer:**

Redis supports a variety of data types commonly used in its value storage. The primary supported value types include:

1. **Strings**: Used for generic text or binary data.
2. **Lists**: Suitable for ordered collections where sequence matters, such as arrays.
3. **Sets**: Ideal for unique elements without order, allowing efficient lookups and eliminating duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain order, useful for operations that require sorted results.
5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Provide key-value storage with ordered pairs, typical in applications requiring key-based access.

These data types are fundamental to Redis's ability to handle large-scale distributed systems and datasets effectively."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query about Redis' data types for values based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.

The context mentions that Redis supports various data types for both keys and values. For values, it lists several options including strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which have unique elements), sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data with some constraints like similarity limits. However, the query specifically asks to name the data types supported by Redis for values.

Wait a minute, I thought in the context about keys, they referred to both keys and values using similar terminology. Let me check if there's a specific section that differentiates between keys and values.

Looking at page 19 of the document, it lists Redis Data Types Keys: - usually strings but can be any binary sequence Values: - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets (unique unsorted string elements) - Sorted Sets - Hashes (string → string) - Geospatial data 20) with similarity 0.17

So, the query is about values, which are listed under ""Values"" as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data.

Therefore, I can confidently answer that Redis supports these value types for both keys and values: Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, and Geospatial data.

The data types supported by Redis for both keys and values are:

- **Strings**
- **Lists** (linked lists)
- **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements)
- **Sorted Sets**
- **Hashes** (string → string)
- **Geospatial data 20)** with similarity 0.17

Okay, so I need to figure out how many data types Redis supports for their values and what they are based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.

The context mentions a document about a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"". It lists several key-value pairs under the section ""Redis Data Types Keys."" The list includes things like ""Redis Data Types Keys: - usually strings but can be any binary sequence"" and then further breaks down Values. It goes into more detail about specific data types.

The query is asking to name the data types supported by Redis for values, so I need to extract that information from the context. Looking at the key-value pairs:

1. The first one says ""Redis Data Types Keys: - usually strings but can be any binary sequence."" This part describes the possible values each field in a key-value pair can have.

2. The next line lists specific data types under Values with their definitions:
   - Strings
   - Lists (linked lists)
   - Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
   - Sorted Sets
   - Hashes (string → string)
   - Geospatial data 20) with similarity 106.03

So, the query is specifically about values, not keys or structures. The key-value pair here clearly states that Redis supports various types for their values: Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, and Geospatial data.

I should make sure I'm only picking out the value-related ones and not any other terminology like ""lists"" which might be confusing as both a key structure and a data type. But in this context, it's clear that ""Lists"" refers to the data type.

Putting it all together, Redis supports six main types for their values:
1. Strings
2. Lists (Data Type: List)
3. Sets (Data Type: Set)
4. Sorted Sets (Data Type: SortedSet)
5. Hashes (Data Type: Dictionary or Map)
6. Geospatial data 20) with similarity 106.03 (Data Type: Geo)

I think that's all the relevant information from the context. The query is about values, so I don't need to worry about keys here.

Redis supports six main types of values:

1. **Strings**: These are simple text or character strings.

2. **Lists**: A collection of items where each item can be any value. It's also known as a linked list.

3. **Sets**: A collection of unique elements stored in an ordered manner, supporting iteration with keys (but no duplicates).

4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but sorted alphabetically, making insertion and iteration more efficient.

5. **Hashes**: Dictionaries that map keys to values using hash functions. They support quick lookups and updates.

6. **Geo-spatial Data 20)**: Represents geospatial information with a key (usually latitude or longitude) associated with a set of coordinates, often in degrees, minutes, seconds format."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
