"Based on the provided context from page 19 of ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", I can accurately answer that:

The data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique, unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

These data types allow for flexible and efficient storage and retrieval of values in Redis!"|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
