"Based on the provided context, I can answer that:

Redis supports the following data types for values:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

These are the value data types supported by Redis, as mentioned in the context."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"A query about Redis!

According to the context, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. **Strings**
2. **Lists** (linked lists)
3. **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements)
4. **Sorted Sets**
5. **Hashes** (string → string)

These are the value data types mentioned in the context, specifically on page 19 of the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs"" PDF."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"A query about Redis!

According to the context, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. **Strings**: A sequence of characters (e.g., ""hello"").
2. **Lists** (linked lists): A collection of strings or binary elements, where each element is a member of the list.
3. **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements): An unordered collection of unique strings.
4. **Sorted Sets**: A set of strings that are sorted in a specific order (e.g., by score).
5. **Hashes** (string → string): A mapping from one string to another, where the key is a string and the value is also a string.

These data types can be used for values in Redis."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo. You are also an expert in AWS as a service.
