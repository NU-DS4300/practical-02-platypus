"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the stages of an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance's life. According to the context, these stages are:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages allow you to manage your EC2 instances effectively, as described in the context from the PDF files."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, specifically from pages 4 and 3 of the ""EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" document, I can accurately answer your query.

The EC2 lifecycle refers to the different states an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can be in. According to the documentation, these states are:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: This permanently deletes the instance.
4. **Reboot**: This restarts an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.

These states provide flexibility in managing your EC2 instances, allowing you to scale up or down as needed, or shut them down temporarily to reduce costs."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
