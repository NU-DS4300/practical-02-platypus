Okay, let me figure out how to answer this query about the data types supported by Redis for values. The user is asking me to name them based on the provided context.

Looking at the context, I see a few sections related to Redis data types. First, there's a section from ""NoSQL Intro"" that mentions some key points about data types in NoSQL databases and then transitions into Redis Data Types. Here, it lists several types like strings, lists, sets, etc., which are supported by Redis for values.

Next, another section titled ""Redis + Python.pdf"" has chunks on string commands using Redis with Python. These don't explicitly mention data types, but they use functions like mset and mget to manipulate the data stored in Redis. The example given uses strings as keys and their corresponding values retrieved as a list.

There's also a reference to a Redis context where Redis is mentioned in context 13. In this context, it talks about various data types supported by Redis, including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data with similarity. The hash type supports strings as keys or values, which is useful for creating custom mappings.

Then, there's a section from "" redis in Context 13"" that provides an overview of how Redis handles different data types. It mentions that Redis can store strings, lists (which are ordered collections), sets (which are unordered and contain unique elements), sorted sets (ordered collections), hashes (which map keys to values), and geospatial data.

Additionally, the user provided a Python example using Redis commands like mset, mget, rset, rincr, etc., which clearly demonstrate how Redis can store various types of data. The commands return different structures—strings for some, lists for others, hashes for operations that modify them, and so on.

So, putting this all together, the key data types supported by Redis include:

1. **Strings**: These are the basic type, used in keys, values, and results.
2. **Sets**: Unordered, can contain duplicate entries but maintain uniqueness.
3. **Lists**: Ordered collections of elements.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but ordered by insertion time.
5. **Hashes (Mappings)**: Used for key-value pairs, which are useful for creating lookups and mappings between keys and values.

The context also mentions that Redis can handle geospatial data with similarity, but the primary focus seems to be on the structured types mentioned above.

Therefore, when answering the user's query about naming the data types supported by Redis for values, I should list these types clearly. It's important to cover both simple and more complex data structures, like sets and lists, which are fundamental in various applications.

The data types supported by Redis for storing values include:

1. **Strings**: The primary type used for keys, values, and results.
2. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements that can have duplicates but maintain uniqueness.
3. **Lists**: Ordered collections of elements where each element is accessible in a specific order.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but ordered by insertion time.
5. **Hashes (Mappings)**: Used for key-value pairs, which are useful for creating lookups and mappings between keys and values.

 Redis supports these types through various commands such as mset(), mget(), rset(), rincr(), and rjoin(), allowing flexibility in data storage and retrieval based on application needs."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out the data types supported by Redis for storing values. Let me go through each of the provided context snippets and see what information is there.

Starting with the first snippet from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf on page 19. It mentions that Redis Data Types have ""Values"" section which states: - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets (unique unsorted string elements) - Sorted Sets - Hashes (string → string) - Geospatial data 20) with similarity 0.17.

So from this, I can extract the main data types: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. That's six data types in total for values in Redis.

Next, looking at the second snippet from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf on pages 5-7. This part talks about string commands like mset, mget, set, get, incr. It doesn't explicitly mention data types but relates to how they're used. The user provided a sample command that uses Redis sets with key-value pairs and demonstrates the count incrementing.

This supports my understanding that Redis can handle various data structures beyond simple strings because it's versatile for different use cases like sets, lists, etc., as shown in the example commands. It reinforces that Redis is good at handling multiple types of values.

The third snippet on page 12 seems to be part of a previous context, but I don't have its content here. Maybe it was about Redis in context 13 or another section. Since it's not available, I'll focus on the snippets I have.

The fourth and fifth snippets from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf are similar to the second snippet, just repeated more times. They show how commands work with sets but don't introduce new data types beyond what's already mentioned in the first snippet.

Putting it all together: The main data types Redis supports for values include strings, lists, sets (both regular and sorted), hashes, and geospatial data. This covers most common use cases and structures within Redis.

Redis is a powerful NoSQL database that supports a variety of data types for storing values. Here are the primary data types it handles:

- **Strings**: Simple text or multi-byte strings.
- **Lists**: Collections where each element is an item. In Redis, lists are implemented as linked lists.
- **Sets**: Uniquely store elements in sets (regular and sorted). Each set can contain duplicate values, but duplicates are ignored.
- **Hashes**: Used for value storage with key-value pairs. Hashes function like dictionaries or objects.
- **Geospatial Data**: Supports geospatial data structures such as points, lines, and polygons, useful for location-based applications.

Redis's flexibility allows it to handle these data types efficiently in various contexts, including both simple and complex operations."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, I'm trying to answer this question about which data types Redis supports for values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and its data types.

First, Redis uses a structure called sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. So, I can think of things like strings, numbers, booleans, etc., but they should be unique. That means if you try to add the same value twice, it might not work as expected, or maybe it just throws an error.

Next, Redis also supports lists, which are ordered and can contain any type of data, including objects. They're similar to arrays in other programming languages. So, for example, a list could hold strings, numbers, even more complex structures like JSON objects.

Sets are another key component. Like sets, they have unique elements and are unordered. However, when using sets with the `mget` method, if you query a set that's not present, it returns an empty array by default. That’s something to note because it can affect how data is retrieved from a set.

Hashes or dictionaries in Redis are based on keys. Each key points to a value, which can be anything—string, number, object, etc. These values are stored as strings to optimize memory usage and query performance. So when you use `mset` with keys like 'key1' and 'key2', the corresponding values can also be any type.

I remember that Redis also supports geospatial data, which involves locations such as latitude and longitude. The geospatial types are represented as strings in parentheses, like (lat:degree, lon:minute), so for example, (40.7128, -74.3965). This is interesting because it includes both numbers and string representations of coordinates.

Looking at the context provided, I see that there's a section on ""Values"" where it lists Redis data types as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (strings to strings), and geospatial data with similarity measures. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

Additionally, the user mentioned using `mset` and `mget` commands in some of their examples. The `mset` function adds elements to a set or list, while `mget` retrieves values by key from sets or lists. These operations are fundamental for managing data structures within Redis.

I should also consider if there's anything else I might be missing. For instance, how do these data types behave when accessed through other methods? Are there specific functions or commands that can help retrieve them differently?

From what I gather, the main data types in Redis for values are strings, lists, sets (with unique elements), sorted sets, hashes (key-value pairs where value is a string), and geospatial data. The specifics might vary slightly depending on how they're used with commands like `mset`, `mget`, etc.

I think I'm covering all the main points here. To sum it up, Redis supports various types of values which include strings, lists, sets (unique elements), hashes (with string values), and geospatial data for latitude and longitude.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values are as follows:

1. **Strings**: Can be any type of value, including numbers, booleans, etc., and can include nested structures if specified.

2. **Lists**: Ordered collections that can contain various data types.

3. **Sets**: Unordered collections with unique elements.

4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but ordered by insertion time.

5. **Hashes**: Key-value pairs where the value is a string, accessed via keys like 'key1' and 'key2'.

6. **Geospatial Data**: Represents location information as strings in parentheses, such as (lat:degree, lon:minute).

These data types are managed using Redis commands like `mset` for setting values and `mget` for retrieving them."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
