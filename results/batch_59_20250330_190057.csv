Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. From the context provided, especially the parts about Redis databases and interactions, I can see that Redis has specific data types it handles.

Looking at page 19 of the document, it mentions:
- Values: Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets
- Hashes (string â†’ string)
- Geospatial data with similarity

Wait, but that's more about values and their types. The query is asking for the data types supported by Redis for values. So I should focus on that section.

The relevant part says it supports strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. Are there any others mentioned? It also talks about being a KV store but can be used with other models like graph, spatial, etc. But the main points are about values.

So Redis handles:
- Strings
- Lists (which are ordered collections)
- Sets (unordered, unique elements)
- Sorted Sets (which maintain order)
- Hashes (key-value pairs where keys and values are strings)
- Geospatial data which includes similarity for geometric data

These seem to be the main types it supports. The other parts in that section talk about being a KV store but not directly about the data types themselves.

The query is straightforward: name the data types supported by Redis for values. So I need to list them as per the context, focusing on their definitions.

I think I've covered all the key points there. Let me just make sure none of these are missing or if I missed any specific terms. The document mentions ""hashes"" and ""geospatial data with similarity 0.17"", so those should be included as data types they handle.

So putting it together, Redis supports strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data (including the similarity aspect).

Redis is a noSQL database that primarily supports several data types for storing values. Based on the context provided:

- **Strings**: These are basic text fields.
- **Lists**: Collections of items where each item has an index.
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements, which can be added multiple times but will only store one instance.
- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain order and allow duplicates.
- **Hashes**: Key-value pairs where both keys and values are typically strings, though this is configurable.
- **Geospatial Data with Similarity**: Represents geometric data such as points, lines, or polygons, with a similarity score that allows approximate matching.

These data types are the primary ones Redis supports for storing values."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for holding values. From the context provided, especially pages 19 and 21 of the NoSQL Intro PDF, it mentions that Redis Data Types have specific roles. The Values section says they can be strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, or geospatial data with similarity.

I should make sure I'm not missing anything else from the context. They talk about Redis being a KV store, but then in the next pages, it says Redis is more than just a KV store; it's also used for graphs and other models. But the query specifically asks about values, so maybe that's all I need.

So, to summarize, Redis supports strings, lists (which are ordered collections), sets (unsorted unique elements), sorted sets (ordered unique elements), hashes which map keys to values, and geospatial data with similarity. That should cover it.
</think>

Redis supports several types of values for holding data:

1. **Strings**: Any binary sequence used as text, such as ""hello world"".
2. **Lists**: Ordered collections of items, like [""item 1"", ""item 2""].
3. **Sets**: Unsorted, unique elements that can be added multiple times but are stored once. For example, {a: 1, b: 2}.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain order when adding and retrieving items. For example, [1, 2, 3].
5. **Hashes (Hash Maps)**: Maps keys to values using key-value pairs. They allow for efficient lookups.
6. **Geospatial Data with Similarity**: Represents geographic data with a similarity score between two objects.

These data types ensure Redis can handle various types of information efficiently."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out which data types Redis supports as values. From the context provided, there are several sections about Redis and its database interactions.

Looking at page 19 of the NoSQL Introduction document, it mentions that Redis can hold various types like strings, lists, sets, etc., but nothing directly says what they're called or if they have specific names beyond being binary sequences. However, from other sections, I know that in Python, there are commands for manipulating these data types.

Then, looking at the page about connecting to Redis with Python (page 6), it shows examples of using mget, mset, set, and incr. These operations handle different types like strings and numbers. So, even though there's no explicit name given in the context, the supported values include a wide range.

I also recall that in other contexts about NoSQL databases, Redis is used for things like strings, lists, sets, hashes, geospatial data, etc. The Python examples might be extending this capability.

So, putting it together, Redis supports various types including strings, lists (which are similar to arrays), sets, sorted sets, and more specialized structures. It's important because these can handle different kinds of data efficiently.

Redis supports a variety of data types as values, which includes:

1. **Strings**: These can be simple or complex sequences of characters.
2. **Lists**: Similar to arrays in other languages, lists contain elements that can be strings or other objects.
3. **Sets**: These store unique elements and are unordered.
4. **Sorted Sets**: A type of set with ordered elements.
5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Mapping keys to values using string keys.
6. **Geospatial Data 20**: This refers to geospatial information, such as geographic coordinates, which Redis can manage.

These capabilities are essential for handling diverse data types in applications that require efficient querying and storage."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
