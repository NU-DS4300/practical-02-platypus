Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by looking at the context provided. There are a few documents here that mention Redis and its database capabilities.

First, I see a document from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf where it mentions Redis provides 16 databases by default with numbers 0 to 15. That's straightforward. But then another document in the same week talks about Redis being a data structure store primarily a KV store but used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc.

However, looking at the subsequent documents from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf, there are mentions of Redis being used in ML with libraries like Simpliﬁed Example. Also, in DS/ML, they talk about feature stores using Redis. But all these documents seem to reference that Redis has 16 databases by default.

Wait, but I recall reading somewhere that Redis supports multiple database engines, not just the storage engines. So perhaps there are different engine types alongside Redis as a store. The document in page 22 of the first PDF mentions ""Direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs (and variations)."" That sounds like it's about Redis Database, which has multiple database engines under Redis.

Looking at the subsequent documents, like page 13 of the same file mentions Redis in ML and DS/ML. So maybe the user is referring to not just storage engines but also other databases that are associated with Redis. But I'm not sure if they're part of the 16 default or separate ones.

I think the main point here is whether the initial statement about 16 default databases stands alone. From what I can gather, Redis supports multiple database engines within its architecture, each acting as a different engine, but it's still considered one service that provides these engines through its Redis Database driver.

So putting it together, the answer is that Redis supports 16 default databases with k/v pairs, and it also uses various other database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc., all as part of its architecture. But if we're talking about just the storage, then it's 16. However, in more detailed contexts, it might refer to multiple engine types.

I should clarify whether the question is asking for the number of storage databases or including other engines. Since the query is simply ""How many databases does Redis support?"" and the provided context mentions both storage engines and associated databases like feature stores, I think the answer would include both aspects. However, without specific information from other sources that mention more than 16, it's safe to say the primary storage engines are 16, but also noting that there are multiple engine types alongside Redis.
</think>

Redis supports 16 default storage databases with k/v pairs, primarily functioning as a KV store. While it can be extended with various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle as separate engines within its architecture, these are not counted separately from the 16 default ones. Additionally, Redis is used in feature stores for machine learning tasks, but this does not expand the number of supported databases beyond the initial 16 storage engines.

Answer: Redis supports 16 storage engines with k/v pairs, primarily functioning as a KV store. While it can be extended with multiple database engines (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) within its architecture, these are considered part of Redis' engine suite and not separate entities from the default 16 storage databases."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the information given carefully.

The first chunk talks about Redis providing 16 default databases, numbered from 0 to 15. That's a clear number here—16. But wait, when I look at the other chunks, there's more detail about what Redis can do with these databases. It mentions KV store, graph, spatial, time series, vector, etc. So it seems like Redis supports many different database models beyond just KV stores.

Looking further, there's a section on using Redis with ML and DS/ML, which suggests that Redis isn't limited to traditional databases but can integrate with other data modeling frameworks. That’s interesting because it shows Redis isn’t confined to one type of database but works well within various systems.

Then there are some files mentioned like ""Redis in Context 13,"" ""Feature Store docs,"" and others, all pointing out that Redis is versatile. However, the initial chunk specifically mentions 16 default databases numbered 0-15. That’s a solid starting point.

I should also check if any other sources or chunks provide additional information about the number of supported databases beyond the 16 mentioned. The section on Python mentions Redis in Python as ""redis-py,"" but that's more about how it integrates with Python, not changing the number of database supports. Similarly, in other files like Feature Store docs and others, there are multiple types of stores explained.

So putting this all together, I'm pretty confident that Redis primarily supports 16 databases. The rest of the context is just expanding on how to use Redis with different technologies or models, but doesn't add more databases it supports. 

I don’t see any other mentions of Redis supporting a different number of databases in any part of the provided information. Therefore, I think the answer is that Redis supports 16 databases.

Redis primarily supports 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. This makes up its default setup when used without integrating it with other technologies or models."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through each part carefully.

First, in the section about Redis and DBs, it mentions that there are 16 default databases by default. That's a good starting point. Then, under the section ""23) with similarity 110.97,"" it says that Redis provides 16 databases by default. So that's 16.

Looking further down in the same context on page 17, there's another chunk about Redis DB and its ranking. It mentions that Redis primarily is a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc., which are less commonly known as KV. But the main point here is again that Redis provides 16 databases by default.

The subsequent part in page 20-21 talks about Redis in context 13, mentioning it's an in-memory database system and supports durability features a) saving snapshots to disk or b) appending-only files that can be rolled forward if data fails. It also mentions Redis has high performance with over 100,000 SET operations per second.

Page 22 discusses the Rich collection of commands for Redis, which doesn't support complex data handling beyond lookup by key. This is more about its simplicity but doesn't change the number of supported databases.

Finally, the section on ""DS/ML"" under the same context explains how Redis can be used in Data Science and Machine Learning, but again, it's emphasizing that Redis supports 16 databases by default.

So putting this all together, Redis is an open-source in-memory database that defaults to supporting 16 different stores. These include KV stores like usual, but also other types such as Graph, Text, etc., which can be used alongside without affecting the number of supported storage engines or databases.
</think>

Redis supports a total of **16 databases** by default when it is initialized. Redis primarily functions as a KV store (Key-Value store), but it can also handle various other data models such as Graph, Text, and Vector spaces, which are considered different ""stores"" for in-memory storage."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
