"I don't know.

The context is about moving beyond the relational model and discussing limitations and challenges of relational databases. It does not seem to be related to AVL trees or any specific types of imbalances that would require multiple rotations. Therefore, I'm unable to provide an accurate answer based on this context. If you have a different context or question, I'll do my best to assist you!"|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
