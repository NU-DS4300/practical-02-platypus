"Based on the provided context, I can accurately answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the stages of an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance's life cycle, which are:

1. Launch - When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. Start/Stop - Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. Terminate - Permanently deleting the instance.
4. Reboot - Restarting an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.

These stages allow you to manage your EC2 instances and customize their behavior as needed."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through during its lifetime. These stages are:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: You can temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: This is when you permanently delete the instance.
4. **Reboot**: You can restart an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages are mentioned in the context provided, specifically from page 4 of the ""EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" document with a similarity score of 0.40."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, specifically from page 4 of the ""EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" file, the EC2 lifecycle consists of four stages:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages allow you to manage and utilize your EC2 instances effectively, depending on your specific use cases and requirements."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
