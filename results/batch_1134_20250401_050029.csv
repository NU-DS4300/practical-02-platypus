Based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to this specific query. The contexts appear to be related to graph data models and binary search trees, but they do not specifically discuss AVL trees or their imbalances. Therefore, I am unable to provide an accurate answer. If you could provide more information or clarify the context, I may be able to assist you better.|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant. 
Use the following context to answer the query as accurately as possible. If the context is 
not relevant to the query, say 'I don't know'."|What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?
I don't know. The provided context does not contain information about AVL trees or their imbalances and the number of rotations required to balance them. It appears to be related to graph data models, binary search trees, data replication, and monotonic read consistency, but it does not address AVL tree imbalances and rotations.|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The provided context appears to be unrelated to AVL trees or balancing techniques. The texts seem to be focused on graph data models, data replication, and database systems, but do not mention AVL trees specifically. Therefore, I am unable to answer this query accurately.|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
