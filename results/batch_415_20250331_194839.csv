Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and its database capabilities.

From the context provided, I see that in the document ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. This part is crucial because it directly answers the query but also gives more context on what those databases do and their features.

The document then talks about Redis as an in-memory database system, which supports durability through snapshots or append-only files. It also mentions that Redis is open-source and can handle various models like KV stores, graphs, spatial data, etc., which are beyond traditional VPS storage solutions. This shows Redis' versatility but doesn't directly impact the number of databases it supports.

Looking further into ""Redis + Python.pdf"", I see that Redis-py is the standard client for Python programming. The document also outlines a Docker deployment setup where host can be localhost or 127.0.0.1, and port mapping is set when creating the container. Importing Redis with specific parameters like db=2, decode_responses=True is mentioned as an example.

All of this confirms that Redis by default supports 16 databases. The other aspects about the server configuration and Python integration are more about how to set up a Docker container but don't change the number of supported databases.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, in the NoSQL DBs.pdf file (page 22), it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It doesn't mention other databases or libraries beyond these. So that's a clear number here: 16.

Then, looking at Redis - It is considered an in-memory database system, but... (they list durability aspects). The key point here is the duration aspect—either saving snapshots or append-only files for roll-forward. This doesn't directly relate to the number of databases it supports.

Moving on to Redis DB.pdf (page 17), it says Redis is a KV store, supporting lookups by key but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. So despite being primarily a KV store, it's versatile and supports multiple data models beyond just keys.

In the Python Redis + Py.pdf (pages 2-13), there are sections on connecting to Redis in Docker containers and using Redis Pipelines. These sections don't provide information about the number of databases Redis supports; they focus more on how to interact with Redis through different environments and languages.

The subsequent paragraphs from pages 4-9 discuss string and hash commands, which further explain how Redis handles data types but again, don't give a count of supported databases.

The last section from page 19 mentions various database types like strings, lists, sets, etc., but again, it doesn't specify the number of databases Redis supports.

So, putting this all together, the key information is in the first part where it clearly states that Redis provides 16 databases by default. The other sections don't add any additional details about the number of supported databases beyond what's already mentioned.

Redis supports a total of **16 databases** by default. This makes it a versatile and efficient in-memory database system.

Okay, so the user is asking about how many databases Redis supports. I remember that Redis has multiple types of databases by default, which is why they're numbered from 0 to 15. That part seems straightforward. But wait, the query is a bit vague—it just asks for the number, not specifying if it's all supported at once or the total count.

Looking back at the context provided, there are several sections discussing Redis's database offerings and how it interacts with others. The first section mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default—numbered 0 through 15. It also talks about durability mechanisms, including snapshots and journaling for roll-forward operations. However, none of this relate directly to the number of databases they support.

So, the user might be confused or just trying to confirm Redis's full range without getting into specifics like how it interacts with other systems. They could be a developer looking to understand if their application can use Redis in various contexts or someone setting up Redis configurations.

I need to make sure I address that Redis supports 16 databases by default, as that's the key point from the context provided. The surrounding sections talk about different database types and their interactions, but they don't change the total count of supported databases. Therefore, my answer should clearly state that Redis supports 16 databases (0-15) and mention the durability features separately.
