"I'm happy to help! However, I must say that the context provided doesn't seem directly related to AVL trees or their imbalances. The topics discussed include data replication, relational databases, NoSQL databases, and concurrency control.

That being said, I'll do my best to provide an answer based on my understanding of AVL trees. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the height of the tree remains relatively small by rotating nodes when the balance factor becomes imbalanced. The balance factor is calculated as the difference between the height of the left subtree and the right subtree.

In an AVL tree, there are three types of imbalances:

1. **Left-heavy**: When the left child of a node has a height greater than its right child by more than 1.
2. **Right-heavy**: When the right child of a node has a height greater than its left child by more than 1.
3. **Unbalanced**: When the balance factor becomes more extreme, requiring multiple rotations to restore balance.

To handle these imbalances, AVL trees use two types of rotations:

1. **Left rotation**: Rotates the right child up to replace the parent node.
2. **Right rotation**: Rotates the left child down to replace the parent node.

When an imbalance occurs, one or more rotations are performed to restore balance and maintain the properties of the AVL tree. In some cases, multiple rotations may be required to resolve a severe imbalance.

"A question that's not directly related to the provided context!

However, I'll do my best to answer it.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure that ensures the height of the left and right subtrees cannot differ by more than one. This balancing is done using rotations: left rotation and right rotation.

Imbalances in an AVL tree can occur when the tree becomes unbalanced, which may happen due to insertions or deletions. There are two types of imbalances:

1. **Left-heavy imbalance**: When the left subtree is taller than the right subtree by more than one level.
2. **Right-heavy imbalance**: When the right subtree is taller than the left subtree by more than one level.

To restore balance, multiple rotations may be required to rebalance the tree. The specific types of rotations needed depend on the type and location of the imbalance:

* For a left-heavy imbalance, a right rotation at the affected node's parent may be sufficient.
* For a right-heavy imbalance, a left rotation at the affected node's parent may be sufficient.

In more complex cases, multiple rotations may be required to rebalance the tree. For example, if the imbalance is due to a series of insertions or deletions that have created a long chain of imbalanced nodes, multiple rotations might be needed to restore balance.

So, to summarize: multiple rotations are required when an AVL tree becomes severely unbalanced due to insertions or deletions, and the imbalances involve complex combinations of left-heavy and right-heavy imbalance."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"I'm happy to help you with your query! However, I must say that the context provided does not seem relevant to the question about AVL trees.

The context appears to be related to database transactions, concurrency, and consistency models. It mentions relational databases, NoSQL databases, and various consistency mechanisms like optimistic concurrency and monotonic read consistency.

On the other hand, the query is asking about imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations. AVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree, and the question seems to be specific to computer science or algorithms.

Given this mismatch, I'll do my best to provide an answer based on my knowledge, but it might not be directly related to the context provided:

In an AVL tree, imbalances can occur when the tree becomes severely unbalanced, which can happen during insertion or deletion operations. In such cases, multiple rotations may be required to restore balance.

Here are some common scenarios that might require multiple rotations in an AVL tree:

1. When a large number of nodes are inserted on one side of the tree, causing it to become severely unbalanced.
2. During deletion, when multiple nodes need to be removed from the same subtree, leading to unbalance.
3. In cases where the AVL tree is subjected to repeated insertions or deletions, causing the tree to become increasingly unbalanced.

To restore balance, the algorithm performs rotations to reorganize the nodes and maintain the AVL tree's properties. The number of rotations required depends on the specific scenario and the complexity of the tree.
