Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer the query ""Name the data types supported by Redis for values."" based on the context provided.

First, I'll go through the context given. It seems to be a PDF discussing Redis and its support for various database types, including in-memory systems, durability features, and supporting different models like KV store, graph, etc. It also mentions Redis as an open-source project with specific documentation.

Looking at the sections related to data types:

- On page 19, it talks about Redis Data Types Keys, listing things like strings, lists (linked lists), sets (unique unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes (string→string), and geospatial data. That seems relevant since the query is about data types supported for values.
  
- Page 18 discusses Redis's durability features, mentioning snapshots on disk at specific intervals or an append-only file with roll-forward capability. This doesn't directly address data types but shows Redis's reliability.

- Page 22 mentions Redis provides 16 databases by default and details direct interaction commands like set, key, get, etc., which are related to how values are stored and accessed.

The rest of the context seems more about Redis as a programming language (Python library called redis) and its documentation. It doesn't provide specific data types for values beyond what's in the first section on keys.

Therefore, focusing back on page 19 where it clearly lists the data types supported for keys: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. This directly answers the query about value types Redis supports.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values are:

- Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets (sorted unique elements)
- Hashes (string → string)
- Geospatial data 20) with similarity 0.31

These types can be used to store and access information efficiently in Redis, particularly suited for KV stores and other specific use cases."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for their values based on the given context. Let's start by reading through the provided document carefully.

Looking at page 19 of ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", it mentions Redis Data Types with keys like 'strings', 'lists', 'sets', etc., and their respective definitions. So, I can extract names from this section: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (string→string), and geospatial data.

Next, page 18 talks about Redis's durability features. It mentions saving snapshots at specific intervals or an append-only file that's a journal for roll-forward if something fails. The text under bullet point b) supports durability with those methods. This might give names like 'snapshots' and 'journal'.

Then, on page 22, it describes Redis as providing multiple databases by default (16 total) without additional naming. It also lists direct interaction commands related to KV pairs, mentioning various languages and libraries. The list of languages is not provided here, but the user's query seems focused on data types.

Putting this together, I'll extract all unique names from these sections. From the Data Types section: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, geospatial data. From the durability part: snapshots and journal. The database count isn't relevant since the focus is on values.

I should make sure there are no duplicates and that each name is accurately transcribed. For example, 'sets' and 'sorted sets' are distinct, as are 'lists'. So, I'll compile a list without repetition.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for their values include:

1. **Strings**: Strings are used to store text, numbers, etc.
2. **Lists**: Used for ordered collections of elements.
3. **Sets**: Unique, unsorted elements stored in a set.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Order-ordered sets that maintain insertion order.
5. **Hashes (String→String)**: Mapped strings to other strings, useful for lookups and forward compatibility with SQL.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Represents geospatial information, such as latitude and longitude.

These names are derived from Redis's specifications regarding its data types."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which data types Redis supports as values. From what I remember, Redis uses a specific model called the Key-Value store architecture. Each value in Redis is stored as a key-value pair. But wait, how does this work exactly? 

I think the main data type Redis uses is the string. Because all data can be broken down into strings at some level. So when you have any kind of data, whether it's numbers, dates, objects, or even arrays, they get converted into strings for storage. That makes sense because strings are easy to work with and handle across different operations.

But there are exceptions. There are lists, which I know are like linked lists where each element is a string. Sets are also mentioned as unique strings, so that's another data type. Sorted sets should be similar but maintain order. Also, hashes come into play for objects, mapping keys to values, and geospatial data with similarity scores.

So putting it all together, Redis primarily uses strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. Geospatial data is supported through similarity 436.20. I'm not sure about the exact details of that number, maybe it's a specific type of geospatial data or something like that.

Wait, what about other types? Does Redis support numbers in some form? Maybe if you convert them to strings, they can be stored as keys. But I think primarily for storage and processing, it's strings. The rest are just variations handled by converting into strings or specific types like lists and sets.

I should also consider that Redis can handle other types when interacting with external data sources. For example, if you're working with JSON, you might convert it to strings, but Redis itself isn't designed for that directly. It's more about the storage of data as strings.

So, in summary, Redis supports a wide range of data types through string representation and specific types like lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. Geospatial data is another specialized type, though it's not a primary value but used alongside similarity scores.
</think>

Redis primarily uses strings for values, with additional data types including lists, sets (both unique and sorted), and hashes. Geospatial data, specifically with a similarity score of 436.20, is supported. 

**Answer:**
Redis primarily supports string-based values as keys and values. It also supports:
- **List**: A linked list of strings.
- **Set**: A collection of unique strings.
- **Sorted Set**: Similar to sets but maintains order.
- **Hash**: Objects mapping keys to strings.
- **Geospatial Data (436.20)**: Specialized for geospatial data with similarity scores.

**Answer:** Redis supports string, list, set, sorted set, and hash data types primarily, with geospatial data also being supported."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
