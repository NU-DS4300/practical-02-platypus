Alright, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me look through each of the documents listed in the context and see if any mention the release date.

First, there's ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12, chunk Redis in Context 13)"". Hmm, this doesn't seem to have a date mentioned here. It's just a page number and a specific content chunk related to Redis. I don't see any release date listed there.

Next up is ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17, chunk Redis DB - Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database - Sometimes called a data structure store - Primarily a KV store, but can be used with other models: Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, Time Series - From db-engines.com Ranking of KV Stores: 18) with similarity 0.28"". This also doesn't mention a release date. It's more about the type and use cases of Redis as a database.

Then there are two instances of ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 14, chunk Redis in DS/ML 15 Source: https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/) with similarity 0.29"". Again, no release date is provided here either. It's part of a document about using Redis with Python and mentions it's maintained by the Redis Company itself.

Looking at the last entry, ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 1, chunk Redis-py 2 - Redis-py is the standard client for Python. - Maintained by the Redis Company itself - GitHub Repo: redis/redis-py - In your 4300 Conda Environment: pip install redis) with similarity 0.31"". Once again, no release date is mentioned here either.

So, after checking all four documents in the context, I can't find any that provide a specific release date for Redis. All of them are about Redis as an API or tool, mentioning its use cases and some technical details like ranking and integration with Python via madewithml. None of these documents talk about when Redis was first released or when it became widely known.

Therefore, based on the context provided, I don't have enough information to determine when Redis was actually released.
</think>

The context provided does not include any information regarding the release date of Redis. All documents discuss Redis as an API tool, its use cases, and specific features such as ranking and integration with Python via madewithml. No mention is made about Redis's official release date.

Alright, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me go through each part of the query and see if any mention of Redis being released is present.

Looking at the provided context, the first paragraph mentions that it's from a PDF called ""Redis + Python.pdf"" and gives several chunks with similarity scores. I'll scan through those paragraphs to find any details about when Redis was released.

In the first chunk, it says: ""Redis in DS/ML 15 Source: https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/"" with similarity 0.29. This seems like a GitHub repository link, not a release date.

Next, the second paragraph is about NoSQL introduction and includes similar chunks. The third chunk mentions Redis as ""a data structure store - Primarily a KV store, but can be used with other models: Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, Time Series."" This doesn't provide a specific release date either.

The fourth chunk in the same PDF is about Redis-py and provides some setup details. The fifth chunk from the second document talks about Redis databases and interaction with commands, again without any mention of a release year.

I should check if any of these sections directly state when Redis was released. Scanning through each paragraph carefully: none of them include information about a specific release date or version number related to the deployment date. It seems like the context doesn't provide that information.

Therefore, based on the given context, there isn't enough detail to accurately determine when Redis was released.
</think>

The provided context does not contain any explicit information regarding the release date of Redis. Therefore, I cannot confirm when Redis was actually released.

Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me go through each chunk to see if there's any mention of Redis release date.

Looking at the first chunk from page 14, it says ""with similarity 183.81."" That doesn't seem relevant because it just mentions that section.

Moving on to the next chunk, which is also part of the same document about Redis in DS/ML. It mentions ""from db-engines.com Ranking of KV Stores: 18"" and talks about Redis being a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph or Vector. That doesn't specify when Redis was released.

The next chunk is from page 0, discussing Redis in Python. It says ""Source: https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/"" which refers to Mad With ML courses. This link isn't giving me a release date either.

Then there's another from page 12 about Redis in context 13, which mentions it as ""with similarity 185.52."" Again, not helpful for the answer.

The following chunk is from page 17 discussing Redis DB and KV store, ranking 18. Doesn't include any release date information.

Another chunk from page 0, again referring to Mad With ML courses but no specific date.

From page 13, it talks about Redis in ML with similarity 228.99, which doesn't help either.

The last chunk is from page 19 discussing Redis Data Types and Keys, mentions setting up Redis in Docker, and includes a note about ports without a password. It also links to geospatial data but that's irrelevant for the release date.

After reviewing all chunks, I don't see any mention of when Redis was released. The context is mostly about Redis as a framework or database, its features, and some related discussions in Python, Docker setups, but nothing indicating Redis was ever released. Therefore, I can't determine the release date from the provided information.
</think>

The context provided does not include any mention of when Redis was released. It focuses on Redis as a framework, KV store, or database system, discussing its features and related discussions in other contexts like Python, Docker, and geospatial data. No specific release date is indicated.
