Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, I see a PDF titled ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" which mentions that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011. The section talks about Cypher as the core language and mentions some plugins like APOC and the Graph Data Science plugin. But these are more advanced features, not necessarily when the language itself was invented.

The question specifically asks when was Neo4j's graph query language invented, so I think it refers to the introduction or creation of Cypher. The PDF does state that Cypher was created in 2011 as a SQL-equivalent for graphs. So the answer should be 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was introduced in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j created its graph query language, which is called Cypher. The context provided includes a document about Cypher, mentioning it as the graph query language for Neo4j. It also talks about how Neo4j was created in 2011 and that there's an Apoc Plug-in that provides hundreds of procedures and functions.

Hmm, let me think. The question is specifically asking when Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented. From the context, it says that Neo4j was created in 2011 with a focus on graph databases, providing a visual way to match patterns and relationships (nodes). It mentions that Cypher is the graph query language used within Neo4j.

So, putting that together, it seems clear that Cypher was developed around 2011. The context also provides more details about why Neo4j chose to use Cypher—because it allows for a visual matching of patterns and relationships (nodes). Additionally, there's an Apoc Plug-in mentioned that offers hundreds of procedures and functions, which suggests that Cypher is part of the core functionality of Neo4j.

Wait, does any other information from the context contradict this? The document doesn't provide any alternative viewpoints or conflicting information. It seems pretty straightforward—the key point is that Neo4j was created in 2011 with Cypher as its graph query language.

I don't see any references to older versions of Cypher mentioned, which would suggest that it's not an older version but rather the latest tool within Neo4j at the time. So yes, I can confidently say that Cypher for Neo4j was created in 2011.

Neo4j introduced its graph query language, Cypher, in **2011** as part of its development to provide a visual way to match patterns and relationships (nodes). The document also mentions an Apoc Plug-in that offers hundreds of procedures and functions, further supporting the use of Cypher within Neo4j.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented. Hmm, I remember hearing about this in my database class a while back. Let me think... I think it's an extension or a new feature added to the original relational model that made databases more flexible.

Wait, wasn't there something called Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that used Cypher? That must have been around before Neo4j came along. So maybe Cypher was created as part of the transition from traditional relational databases like MySQL or SQL Server into a graph database context?

I recall reading somewhere that Cypher was developed in the early 2010s, possibly 2013. It was used by companies like Facebook and Google to query their data structures, which were traditionally tables but now needed more dynamic and efficient querying methods.

So putting this together, Neo4j's graph query language started being used with Cypher, which was part of the evolution from relational to graph databases. The original model for databases had its own query languages, like SQL for relational, but Cypher probably came first as a separate tool or a plug-in for relational databases.

Therefore, Cypher wasn't invented by Neo4j; it was already an existing language before the company got into the graph database space with Neo4j. So when Neo4j's graph query language was introduced, that's not when Cypher itself was created, but rather another step in the database evolution.
</think>

Cypher, the graph query language, evolved from an older relational query language used in traditional databases such as MySQL and SQL Server before Neo4j was developed. It was part of the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) trend during that period. Therefore, when Neo4j's graph query language was introduced, Cypher had already been in use for many years.

**Answer:** Cypher was not invented by Neo4j; it evolved from an existing relational query language before the company transitioned into graph databases."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
