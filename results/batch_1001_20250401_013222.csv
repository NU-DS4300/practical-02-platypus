Alright, let me figure out how to answer the query. The user is asking, ""How many databases does Redis support?"" and has provided a context. 

Looking at the context, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default with numbers ranging from 0 to 15. So I can directly use this information from the context.

I should make sure my answer is accurate based on the given context and not rely on any other parts of the text. The context is relevant because it clearly states that there are 16 databases, so my response should reflect that without adding anything extra.

So, putting it together, the answer is straightforward: Redis supports 16 databases in total.
