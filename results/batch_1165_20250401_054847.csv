"According to the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the stages that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This stage involves temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance. You can start or stop the instance as needed.
3. **Terminate**: In this stage, the instance is permanently deleted.
4. **Reboot**: This stage restarts an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages make up the lifecycle of an EC2 instance in AWS."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various states that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can be in. These states are:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an EC2 instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: You can temporarily suspend the usage of an instance without deleting it. This state allows you to restart the instance later without losing any data on the root volume.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently delete the instance, which is equivalent to deleting a virtual machine.
4. **Reboot**: Restart an EC2 instance without terminating it, which can be useful for maintenance or troubleshooting purposes.

These states are essential in managing your EC2 instances and ensuring they are running efficiently and effectively."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different states or stages that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can go through during its lifetime.

According to the context, these stages are:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance. You can restart the instance later by starting it again.
3. **Terminate**: This permanently deletes the instance, effectively ending its life cycle.
4. **Reboot**: This restarts an instance without affecting data on the root volume.

These stages collectively form the EC2 lifecycle, giving you control over your instances' creation, usage, and disposal."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
