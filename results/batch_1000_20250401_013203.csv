Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and where I've heard it mentioned. I remember that Redis is a data engineering platform that's widely used for tasks like scaling applications and processing large datasets. 

I think Redis first started as an open-source project in 2014, but I'm not exactly sure when it was officially released. Maybe around late 2014 or early 2015? There was some mention of the project's roots going back to C# and .NET languages at a time called the ""Starter Period,"" which was from August 2013 to January 2016. That might have influenced the development direction.

Wait, but Redis wasn't released as an open-source project until later. I think it came out of the merger of two companies, Red Hat and IBM. I believe that merge happened in March 2015. So, I remember seeing a product announcement for Redis around there. The exact date might have been March or April 2015, but I'm not certain. 

I also recall some sources mentioning the release dates as March 2015 and then again in 2016. It's possible that Redis was released multiple times, with a major version after its initial release. However, I think the official launch date for the stable version of Redis is often cited as March 27, 2015. 

To be thorough, I should check some reliable sources or articles where Redis is mentioned in technical contexts. I remember reading that many companies have integrated Redis into their products, and when they released their versions, it was at around that time. So putting it all together, Redis was first released as an open-source project a few months after its merger with IBM, but the stable release happened much earlier.

Redis was first introduced as an open-source project in late 2014 or early 2015, influenced by its roots in C# and .NET languages. However, Redis itself wasn't released until March 2015 through a merger with IBM. The stable release of the project occurred around March 27, 2015, which marked an official version, allowing for significant adoption and usage."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me start by recalling any information I have about Redis. From what I remember, Redis is a big data streaming platform that's been around for a while now. I think it started as an internal tool at Google, probably in the late 2010s or early 2013.

I believe Redis was initially used to improve their internal systems and reduce costs. But since then, it gained popularity because of its open-source nature and flexibility. That must have been around from at least 2015 onwards. I recall that the first version, Redis 1.x, was released in 2015. Then there were updates every few years after that.

Looking back at the context provided, it mentions ""page 12, chunk Redis in Context 13"" with a similarity score of 0.28. I'm not sure what this means exactly, but perhaps it's an indicator of how relevant the information is to the query about when Redis was released. Since the query didn't specify any particular version or features, just the release date, focusing on the general period seems appropriate.

I don't remember any specific release dates beyond 2015 or later for Redis. It's possible that older versions were around before that, but they might not be as widely used today. I also think about how Redis handles memory and storage, which is important because it affects its current state and future availability. But that doesn't change the fact that Redis has been around since at least 2015.

So putting this together, I'm pretty confident that Redis was released in early 2015 or later. There might have been specific versions before that, but they were probably not as prominent as Redis 1.x and beyond.

Redis was released starting from the mid-2015s. The first version, Redis 1.x, was introduced around 2015. Subsequent updates followed in increments of three years. While Redis 6.x onwards became popular with its open-source nature and flexibility, the earliest general release date is early 2015.

**Answer:** Redis was released starting from mid-2015 or later."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Redis was released. I remember that Redis is a popular open-source tool for managing in-memory databases, and it's used a lot in machine learning workflows. The user provided a context from a document about Redis, specifically mentioning page 14 where the date ""2016"" is shown as Redis being introduced or released. They also refer to a source link for more information on feature stores.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. I know that Redis was introduced in 2015 and became popular before 2016. There were some delays with updates but the official release date wasn't mentioned yet. The document might just be using ""released"" loosely to mean when it was considered ready for use, which would be around 2015-2017.

I should check my facts again. Redis was released in early 2016 as a Java-based open-source project, and Python support came later with some implementations or extensions. So, the date they mentioned might be referring to the initial release rather than a full release. The source link points to an article on MadWithML about feature stores, which could tie into how Redis is integrated into machine learning workflows in Python.

I should also consider if there's any more recent information. Redis has been updated multiple times since 2016, so the exact date of ""released"" might have changed, but I think it was around that time before significant updates. Maybe the date they're citing is from an older version or some internal reference rather than a literal release.
</think>

The document references Redis being introduced in early 2016, referred to as ""released,"" even though it wasn't fully ready for use until later that year. The source link points to MadWithML's course on feature stores, which may discuss Redis integration in Python workflows.

**Answer:**

Redis was introduced and widely adopted around early 2016. It wasn't fully released as a standalone tool until later that year due to updates and refinements, such as adding Python support through some implementations or extensions. The exact date might have been considered ""released"" at the time of its initial use, so Redis's official release period is slightly earlier than 2016."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
