Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From what I remember in my studies and from the provided context, Redis is a big name in database technologies. The context mentions that there are 16 default databases by default for Redis. Each of these is numbered from 0 to 15, which makes sense as numbers go up to 15 because they usually count starting at zero.

I think I remember seeing something about the Redis Database and Interaction documentation where they talk about specific k/v pairs. They mentioned that there are no other names associated with them except their numbering. So if there are 16 databases, each numbered from 0 through 15, that should mean Redis supports 16 different databases at once.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The context says ""Direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs (and variations)."" That part seems like it's talking about how you work with the databases in Redis, using commands that interact with the underlying data storage system, which I think is distributed across multiple nodes.

So if they're supporting 16 default databases, each numbered, then when someone uses Redis, they can choose a subset of these 16 to connect. That makes sense because having too many could be resource-intensive. But why 16? Maybe it's based on the number of physical servers or something like that.

I'm also trying to recall if there are any other names besides their numbering for these databases. The context doesn't mention anything else, so I think it's just numbered from 0 to 15. So Redis supports exactly 16 databases by default when you're setting up your system.

So putting it all together, the answer should be that Redis supports 16 databases because there are 16 default databases with numbers from 0 to 15.

Redis supports 16 databases as they are numbered from 0 to 15. These are the default databases provided by Redis when setting up a system.

The number of databases Redis supports is straightforward: it includes 16 default libraries.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and NoSQL databases.

From the context provided, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. Each of these can be referred to as ""k/v pairs."" So, at a glance, Redis has 16 different databases running simultaneously in the same system. 

I think the answer is straightforward here because the context clearly states this number. But wait, I should make sure there's no other information about additional databases or if it's just the default ones mentioned.

Looking back at the context: ""Direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs (and variations). Many language libraries available as well."" It doesn't mention any extra or alternative databases beyond 0-15. So, based on what's given, it's safe to say that Redis supports 16 databases.

I don't see any other numbers in the context related to this, so I can confidently conclude that Redis has 16 supported databases.

The answer is 16.
