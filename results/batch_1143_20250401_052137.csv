"According to the provided context from page 19 of ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", Redis supports the following data types for values:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique, unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

These are mentioned as the possible value types in Redis, specifically listed under ""Redis Data Types: Keys"" and ""Values""."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"A nice question!

According to the context and the Redis documentation, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. **Strings**: Simple string values.
2. **Lists** (linked lists): A list of strings or binary sequences.
3. **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements): A set of unique strings.
4. **Sorted Sets**: A set of strings with a score, which can be used for sorting and indexing.
5. **Hashes** (string → string): A hash table where keys are strings and values are strings.

These data types are mentioned in the context, particularly in the sections about Redis data types and commands."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"A query about Redis!

According to the provided context, Redis supports the following data types for values:

1. **Strings**: a sequence of bytes
2. **Lists** (linked lists): an ordered collection of strings
3. **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements): a collection of unique strings
4. **Sorted Sets**: an ordered collection of strings with scores
5. **Hashes** (string → string): a mapping of strings to strings

These data types can be used to store and manipulate values in Redis.

Note that there is no explicit mention of other data types, such as integers or booleans, which are not mentioned in the provided context."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
