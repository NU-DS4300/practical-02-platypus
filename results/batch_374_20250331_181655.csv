I don't know. The provided context is about moving beyond the relational model and discussing limitations and challenges of relational databases, while the query is about AVL trees and their balance requirements. These topics are unrelated, so I'm unable to provide a relevant answer.|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The context provided is about relational databases and their limitations, whereas the query is about AVL trees and the conditions that require multiple rotations. The two topics are unrelated, so I'm unable to provide an answer based on this context. If you'd like to provide more information or a different context related to AVL trees, I'll do my best to help!|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
