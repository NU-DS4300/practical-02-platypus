"I see that the query doesn't have anything to do with relational databases, NoSQL databases, or AWS. The context provided seems to be about data replication and consistency in distributed systems.

However, I'll answer the query as accurately as possible:

In an AVL tree, imbalances occur when the height of one subtree differs significantly from the other by more than a certain threshold (usually 1). This imbalance requires multiple rotations to restore the balance property. Specifically:

* A left-left or right-right imbalance (also known as a ""long"" or ""tall"" node) requires two rotations: first, rotate the root node, and then the resulting child node.
* A left-right or right-left imbalance (also known as an ""L-shape"" or ""Z-shape"") requires three rotations: first, rotate one side, then the other, and finally the root node.

These multiple rotations are necessary to maintain the AVL tree's balance property, which ensures that search, insertion, and deletion operations remain efficient."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"I see that the query is not related to the context provided, which appears to be about relational databases, NoSQL databases, and AWS as a service. The query is actually about AVL trees, which is a data structure used for balancing binary search trees.

To answer your question, an AVL tree requires multiple rotations in the following situations:

1. Left-left imbalance: When the left child of a node has a height greater than the node's height, and the left child's left child also has a height greater than its parent's height.
2. Right-right imbalance: When the right child of a node has a height greater than the node's height, and the right child's right child also has a height greater than its parent's height.

In both cases, multiple rotations are required to restore balance to the tree. The exact sequence of rotations depends on the specific imbalance and the current state of the tree.

Please note that this answer is not related to the context provided, but I'm happy to help with any query that doesn't require deep knowledge of relational databases, NoSQL databases, or AWS as a service."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"I apologize, but the query does not seem to be related to the provided context. The context appears to be discussing relational databases, NoSQL databases, and graph data models, as well as topics such as replication lag and monotonic read consistency.

An AVL tree is a specific type of self-balancing binary search tree, which is not mentioned in the provided context. To answer this question accurately, I would need more information about AVL trees or related concepts.

However, if you'd like, I can try to provide an answer based on my general knowledge of computer science and data structures."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
