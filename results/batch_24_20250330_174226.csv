Alright, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me go through each relevant paragraph step by step.

First, in From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17), there's a line that says ""Redis provides 16 databases by default."" That suggests Redis has multiple instances or versions. However, I don't see any mention of release dates here.

Looking at the next paragraph from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22), it mentions Redis supports durability with snapshots and append-only files. It also talks about performance metrics like 100,000 SET operations per second but doesn't provide release information.

Then in From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 1), it says Redis is the standard client for Python. There's no mention of when Redis was released here either.

Another relevant point from page 23 mentions Redis being developed since 2009, but without a specific date.

I don't see any references to release dates in these sections. The context discusses Redis as an in-memory database system and provides some performance metrics but nothing about when it's introduced or when it was released. Therefore, I can't determine the release date from the provided information.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the context provided. Let me look through each section of the text.

First, I see ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17, chunk Redis DB - Redis). Similarity 0.27."" The text here mentions Redis is an open-source in-memory database and supports various models like KV store. It doesn't mention when Redis was released, just that it's maintained by the Redis Company itself.

Then there's ""Redis + Python.pdf (page 1, chunk Redis-py 2 - Redis-py is the standard client for Python."" Wait, this section seems to focus on Redis.py or Redis-py being a Python library. It mentions it's maintained by Redis and lists its GitHub repository as redis/redis-py.

I also see ""Redis Database and Interaction.pdf (page 22, chunk Redis - It is considered an in-memory database system..."" This part talks about Redis supporting durability with snapshots or append-only files but doesn't mention when it was released. 

Then another ""Redis in Context 13"" section on page 23 mentions Redis supports various KV models and does not handle complex data with only lookup by key. It also lists Redis as providing several databases: 0 to 15, which might indicate the range of Redis instances but doesn't mention release date.

On page 19, it says Redis was originally developed in 2009 in C++ but is maintained by Redis and supports various models without complex indexing. It also lists Redis as having several databases from 0 to 15 and mentions Redis being very fast with over 100,000 SET operations per second.

Looking through all the sections, none directly mention when Redis was released except for how it's maintained by the company itself in some sections. The part about Redis-py being a Python client suggests that Redis itself might be an older product but is used as a Python library now. It doesn't provide release date info.

So, based on the context given, there isn't enough information to determine when Redis was released because the release dates are more relevant to its latest products or versions rather than its core features and maintenance.
</think>

The provided context does not contain explicit information about when Redis was released. Redis is maintained by the Redis Company itself and has been around for many years, with early development dating back to 2009 in C++. However, there are sections discussing Redis-py as a Python client and Redis as a KV store, which might indicate that Redis itself isn't directly mentioned but is referred to. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine Redis's release date.

Answer: I don't know."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the context provided. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, looking at the context, there are a few documents listed. The first one is ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" with page 17, chunk about Redis. It mentions Redis is an open source in-memory database, sometimes called a data structure store. It's used for Key-Value stores and can handle various models like graph, spatial, etc.

The next document is another one from the same title, I think it's pages 22 to page 23, which talks about Redis providing 16 databases by default. It says there's no other name associated with Redis and that it supports durability features: saving snapshots or being append-only. Redis was developed in 2009 in C++.

Then, another document from the same title goes up to page 18, which mentions Redis is an in-memory database but has no secondary indexes. It also states that Redis doesn't handle complex data and can be very fast with operations like SET being over 100,000 per second.

The third document is about Redis + Python. It lists Redis commands on pages 3 to 4. However, it doesn't provide a specific release date for Redis in the context provided.

Putting this together, from the other documents, I know Redis was developed in 2009. The one that mentions Redis and Python probably refers to versions like Redis-Python or Redis Command List, which are separate projects. Since those don't give dates, but the development version is from 2009, it's likely that Redis itself has been around longer.

So, based on this information, I can conclude that Redis was released in early 2009.
