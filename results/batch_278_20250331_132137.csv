"I don't know.

The context provided seems unrelated to the query about AVL trees and rotations. The texts appear to be discussing database concepts, replication, consistency, and leader failures, which are not relevant to the question about AVL trees. Therefore, I'm unable to provide an accurate answer based on the given context."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"I don't know.

The context provided appears to be a collection of documents related to databases, data replication, and graph data models. There is no mention of AVL trees or any specific imbalances that would require multiple rotations in an AVL tree. The query seems to be unrelated to the given context."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The provided context appears to be about various database models, data replication, and graph data models. It does not contain any information about AVL trees or their specific requirements for rotation. An AVL tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, and its rebalancing mechanisms are not related to the topics discussed in the provided context.|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
