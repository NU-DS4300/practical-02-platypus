"A query about AVL trees!

Based on the context, I'll do my best to provide an accurate answer.

According to the notes from Introduction to Graph Data Model (page 13), a binary search tree (BST) is mentioned as a type of binary tree where every node in the left subtree is less than its parent and every node in the right subtree is greater than its parent. An AVL tree is a self-balancing BST, which means it ensures that the height of the tree remains relatively small by performing rotations when necessary.

To answer your query: In an AVL tree, multiple rotations are required to restore balance when there is a deep imbalance, specifically:

* A left-left (LL) or right-right (RR) rotation sequence can occur when inserting a new node and the AVL tree becomes significantly unbalanced.
* This can happen when a node is inserted in a location where the tree was already very unbalanced, causing multiple rotations to be needed to restore balance.

In summary, multiple rotations are required in an AVL tree to balance it when there is a deep imbalance, typically caused by inserting a new node that pushes the tree out of balance."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"A question about AVL trees!

Based on the provided context, I've found relevant information from page 13 (chunk Trees) and page 11 (chunk Cyclic vs Acyclic) of the ""Introduction to Graph Data Model"" PDF.

According to those pages, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. To maintain balance, AVL trees use rotations when the height of one subtree differs from the other by more than one. Specifically:

* **Left-left imbalance** (LL): When a node's left child has two children, and the rightmost leaf node in the left subtree has an additional level compared to the rightmost leaf node in the right subtree.
* **Right-right imbalance** (RR): When a node's right child has two children, and the rightmost leaf node in the right subtree has an additional level compared to the rightmost leaf node in the left subtree.

In both cases, multiple rotations are required to restore balance. The specific sequence of rotations depends on the exact imbalance and the tree structure."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"I can help you with that!

According to the provided context, there is no mention of AVL trees or their imbalances. The topics discussed are graph data models, arrays of tuples, linked lists, weighted vs unweighted graphs, and cyclic vs acyclic graphs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to your query.
