Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, there's a section on Redis DB which mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system and supports durability features like saving snapshots or being append-only with a journal. It also talks about Redis being open source, in-memory, KV store, can handle various models like graph, spatial, text search, etc., and isn't complex for data handling.

Then, in the context, there's another section from page 19 which lists Redis Data Types Keys: including strings, lists (linked lists), sets (unique unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes (strings to strings), and geospatial data with a similarity score. But that seems like keys used for other purposes, not values themselves.

Looking further down in the context, from page 17 about Redis DB, it says Redis is an open-source KV store but can handle more complex models. Then, at page 22, there's a chunk mentioning that Redis provides 16 databases by default and direct interaction through commands for setting and getting k/v pairs.

So, the data types discussed in terms of storage are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. These seem to be values that can be stored as keys in a structure. Even though Redis uses these for keys, they're also used as the actual values being stored in the database. Therefore, I should list these key types as the ones supported by Redis for values.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for storing values include:

- Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets (ordered sets of unique elements)
- Hashes (strings to strings)
- Geospatial data with similarity scores.

These key types are used both as keys and values in the database, reflecting Redis's structure-based approach."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query about the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The user has given a lengthy paragraph with several chunks related to Redis as a database system. Each chunk seems to discuss different aspects of Redis, including its structure, commands, and some specific examples.

Looking at the query: ""Name the data types supported by Redis for values."" I need to find out which data types Redis primarily supports for holding values. From what I see in the context, there are mentions of several types.

In chunk 19, it says Redis uses KV store with keys and values, supporting various data types like strings, lists, sets, hashes, and geospatial data. Then in other parts, specific examples include setting counts to zero, incrementing a key, retrieving multiple fields, and combining multiple keys into one.

So the main data types supported are strings (for both keys and values), lists, sets (which can be unsorted), sorted sets (ordered), hashes (which store pairs where keys are strings mapping to strings), and geospatial data. 

I should make sure I'm only listing numerical data types here since the query specifically mentions value types. Also, the context doesn't mention other languages or models like graphs or vectors; it's focused on Redis as a Python library.

I need to structure the answer clearly, perhaps listing each data type with their respective examples. Make sure each command example is relevant and supports one of these types.
</think>

The primary data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. **Strings**: Used for keys and values, supporting any binary sequence such as strings or lists.
2. **Lists (Array)**: A collection of items that can be unsorted.
3. **Sets**: Unique elements that support insertion, deletion, and membership checks.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Ordered by default.
5. **Hashes**: Stores key-value pairs where keys are strings mapping to strings.

Examples include commands like `r.set`, `r.get`, `r.incr`, and `r.mget`, which demonstrate these data types in use."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values. Let me start by looking through the context provided.

From the first file, ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" it talks about Redis as an in-memory database system and mentions that it's used as a KV store but can be extended with other models like graphs or vectors. It also notes that Redis supports various data types for values, including strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which are unordered and unique), sorted sets, hashes (which are functions transforming inputs to outputs), and geospatial data.

Looking at the second file, ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" it introduces Redis as a client for Python. It gives examples of commands like setting values with r.set(), getting values with r.get(), incrementing counts with r.incr(), and using mset() to set multiple keys in a dictionary. It also shows how to retrieve multiple values at once using mget(). In one example, it uses mget('key1', 'key2', 'key3') which returns the corresponding values from the dictionary.

Putting this together, Redis supports strings for single values, lists (which are like arrays with possibly duplicated elements), sets (which are unordered and unique), sorted sets (which maintain an order after insertion), hashes (which can be functions that return arbitrary sequences of bytes), and geospatial data which involves spatial coordinates. There's also mention of handling multiple values at once using mget().

I should make sure I don't confuse this with other in-memory databases, but based on the context given, Redis seems to support these types for its value storage.

Redis supports various data types for values, including:

1. **Strings**: Single or repeated characters.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Ordered collections of elements where each element is a single item.
3. **Sets (Unordered Unique Elements)**: Uniquely identified sets where insertion order does not matter and duplicates are automatically removed.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Ordered sets where duplicates are allowed, but they must be explicitly managed.
5. **Hashes (Hash Tables)**: Key-value pairs where keys can be arbitrary sequences of bytes.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Data that includes geographic information, such as coordinates.

Additionally, Redis provides a method to fetch multiple values at once using mget(), which is useful for handling large datasets efficiently."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
