Okay, so I need to figure out what Redis supports for value types. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and its data model.

From the context provided, specifically page 19 of the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" document, it mentions several key types in the section on Redis Data Types Keys. The information is that Redis supports a variety of data types for values, including strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which are unique and unsorted string elements), sorted sets, and hashes. Additionally, it notes that Redis also handles geospatial data with similarity scores.

Wait, does the document mention anything about other types? Let me think again. The key points in the context were: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. So those seem to be the main ones. I don't recall Redis mentioning other types like integers or dates explicitly here.

I should also consider if there are any aspects of Redis that go beyond what's directly stated in this section. For example, does Redis support integer values? Maybe through specific keywords or structures? Similarly, dates could be handled as either values or timestamps, but again, the context doesn't provide information on that.

Since the query is specifically about naming the data types supported by Redis for values and the provided context only lists those mentioned in that section, I think it's safe to stick with what's stated. There might not be additional details in this document beyond what's covered here.

Therefore, based solely on the given context, the data types Redis supports for values are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data.

Based on the provided context from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" Redis supports the following data types for value storage:

- **Strings**: Used to store text, numbers, or special characters.
- **Lists**: Implemented as linked lists of values.
- **Sets**: Stores unique string elements; duplicates are not allowed.
- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintains elements in a sorted order.
- **Hashes**: Maps keys to values using cryptographic hashing.
- **Geospatial Data**: Handles geospatial information with similarity scores.

These types allow Redis to store and manage various data structures efficiently."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for holding values. I remember that Redis has its own set of data types similar to some NoSQL databases like MongoDB and MySQL, but they're designed with some specific characteristics in mind.

First, the user mentioned there are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. Let me break these down one by one. Strings are straightforward—just text. Lists are like arrays where each element is a string or another list. That makes sense because it allows for ordered collections. Sets can be a bit tricky because they don't allow duplicates; each element appears only once. They're useful for unique data, though you have to make sure that adding the same value multiple times doesn't duplicate.

Sorted sets are similar to sets but offer an order by specifying whether elements are in ascending or descending order. That might come in handy for querying data that's structured with a specific priority or sequence. I think Redis supports these types because they're common structures used in various applications, like caching algorithms where you need ordered results.

Hashes map strings to other strings, which is great for storing key-value pairs because it allows efficient lookups and operations. The user mentioned similarity, so that probably refers to the ability of hashes to take similar keys into account, maybe with some rounding when comparing them. That's a useful feature for applications where exact key matches aren't always necessary.

Geospatial data is another point to consider. Redis supports geospatial tuples which can include latitude and longitude coordinates. This might be used in location-based services or mapping applications. I wonder if the precision of these coordinates could be an issue, but maybe they handle it well within their constraints.

I should also remember that while these types are common, they're not as flexible as some other database models. For example, noSQL databases offer more complex structures like bags or custom data types, which Redis doesn't provide. However, for typical value storage needs, the support from Redis is pretty solid.

Putting it all together, I can list out each type and its specific use case. That way, someone reading my answer can understand how to choose the right structure based on their needs without worrying too much about unique features like exact string matches or geospatial precision.

The data types supported by Redis for holding values are as follows:

1. **Strings**: Used for text data and often formatted in double quotes. They can also include special characters if properly escaped.

2. **Lists**: Similar to arrays, they store ordered collections of elements that can be strings or other lists. They support adding, removing, and iterating over elements.

3. **Sets**: These store unique elements without duplicates. They don't support order, but you can specify an order by setting the SORT command.

4. **Sorted Sets**: An extension of sets that maintain a specific order (ascending or descending). Useful for structured data where sequence matters.

5. **Hashes**: Map keys to values and offer rounding functionality when comparing keys, which is beneficial in scenarios requiring approximate equality checks.

6. **Geospatial Data**: Supports tuples containing latitude and longitude coordinates, suitable for geospatial applications with consideration of precision limits."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the data types supported by Redis based on the provided context. The user has given me a section from a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" specifically page 19 and chunk about Redis Data Types. 

Looking at the context, it mentions that Redis supports several data types for values:
- Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial data with similarity 20)
- And hashes (string → string)

I should make sure I include all these points clearly in the answer, ensuring each type is mentioned accurately. Since the query specifically asks for value types, I'll focus on strings, lists, sets, etc., as those are the primary value types Redis supports.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

1. **Strings**: These are used for text and other textual data.
2. **Lists**: These store collections of items in a linked list structure.
3. **Sets**: These are unordered collections of unique strings, ensuring efficient lookups.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain order, which is useful for ordered data.
5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: These map keys to values, allowing key-value pairs and complex relationships.
6. **Geospatial Data**: This includes geolocation information with a similarity score of 20).

Each of these types plays a crucial role in Redis's support for various datasets and operations."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
