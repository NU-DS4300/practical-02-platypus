"A query about Redis!

According to the provided context, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. **Strings**: These can be used as simple key-value pairs or as a binary-safe store.
2. **Lists (linked lists)**: A list of strings that can be accessed by index.
3. **Sets (unique unsorted string elements)**: A set of unique strings, unordered and unindexed.
4. **Sorted Sets**: A set of strings with scores, allowing for efficient sorting and retrieval.
5. **Hashes (string → string)**: A key-value store where keys are strings and values are also strings.

No complex data types like arrays or objects are supported in Redis."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
