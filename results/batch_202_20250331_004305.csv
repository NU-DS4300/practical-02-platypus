Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me look through the context provided.

The context has several documents about Neo4j and related topics like its query language and plugins. Specifically, from page 2 of Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher, it mentions that Neo4j's graph query language is created in 2011 with the goal of providing a SQL-equivalent for graph databases.

Another document, ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf,"" also discusses Neo4j's query language. It says that Neo4j's Cypher language was introduced around 2011. 

So both sources mention that Neo4j's graph query language started being used or developed in 2011. I don't see any conflicting information here. The other documents seem to talk more about the system and its applications but don't add new info on when Cypher was introduced.

Therefore, it seems safe to conclude that Neo4j's graph query language was invented around 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was introduced in 2011. This conclusion is supported by the documents provided, which detail its introduction and development goals."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, it seems like there are several documents and notes that talk aboutNeo4j and its query language. Let me go through them step by step.

First, I see a PDF titled ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011 - Goal: SQL-equivalent language for graph databases..."" This mentions that the goal is to create a SQL-equivalent language for graph databases. So, this suggests that the original language was developed around 2011.

Next, there's another PDF titled ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 11, chunk Adding an Edge with No Variable Names..."" which shows how to create a relationship between users in Neo4j. This is definitely a graph-related feature and part of the system's functionality. The fact that Neo4j supports directed edges indicates it's a graph database.

Then there's a note from ""05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 4, chunk NoSQL..."") mentioning that the original name was ""NoSQL,"" referring to databases built on non-SQL systems like relational ones. This confirms that Neo4j is indeed a graph-based database system.

Another document, ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 9, chunk Neo4j Atlas released in 2016 → documentdb as a service 10 https://www.mongodb.com/company/our-story)"" states that MongoDB was initially referred to as a document-based database but became known as a graph database. This ties back to the system's name and its use of graph data structures.

Looking at the notes from other sources like ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" and ""NoSQL - 'Non-Only'..."" which also discuss how graph databases handle connections between nodes, further solidifies that Neo4j uses a graph model for its data structure.

So putting it all together, the query language in Neo4j was created around 2011 to serve as an SQL equivalent for graphs. It supports directed edges and is used with features like APOC Procedures for efficient graph algorithms. The documents provided align closely with that timeline, indicating that the query language's invention date falls in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language was invented around 2011 to serve as an SQL-equivalent language for graph databases. 

**Answer:** Neo4j's graph query language was developed starting from 2011, aiming to provide a SQL-compatible solution for handling graph-based data."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided a context about Neo4j and some documents that discuss its features, history, and how it compares to other graph databases like CosmoDB and Neptune. The query they're trying to answer is about when Neo4j's graph query language was created or invented.

First, I'll look through the context for any mentions of a graph query language in Neo4j. Scanning each section: From 10 - Neo4j.pdf starts with ""Cypher,"" which is a graph query language used in Neo4j. Another document, From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf, also mentions Cypher as the query language. There's no direct mention of when it was invented or introduced; instead, it seems to be about its use and integration with the platform.

Since there are no specific details in the context about Neo4j's history regarding the creation of a graph query language, I need to infer based on other information provided. The user also mentioned comparing Neo4j with others like CosmoDB and Neptune, which might indicate that Neo4j is still developing or building upon existing concepts.

Looking back at the documents linked in the context, one mentions the introduction of Neo4j Browser starting from localhost:7474, but that's more about how to use the platform. Another document talks about the ACID compliance and distributed computing capabilities, which are features associated with graph databases, not necessarily query languages.

I recall that some graph databases were developed earlier for SQL-based processing before they incorporated graph capabilities. For example, the paper titled ""Building a Graph-Based Query Language on top of a Relational Database"" discusses integrating graph logic into relational systems. This suggests that Neo4j is building upon such ideas rather than introducing new query languages.

Given this reasoning, I can conclude that Neo4j's graph query language was not introduced specifically in the provided context but is built into its architecture to enhance querying based on graph patterns and relationships. Therefore, there might be no direct mention of a specific发明 date for the query language in the given information.
</think>

Neo4j's graph query language (Cypher) was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it builds upon existing relational query languages like SQL to enhance graph-based queries. Based on references and discussions, Neo4j incorporates graph logic into its architecture, suggesting that Cypher is used for querying based on graph patterns rather than introducing a new query language.

**Answer:** Neo4j's graph query language (Cypher) was not explicitly introduced in the provided context but is used to enhance querying based on graph patterns."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
