Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that Neo4j is a graph database framework developed by GraphAnalytics. The user mentioned that the context provided includes some documents about Neo4j and its features. Looking at the context, I see two key sections related to Cypher and the plugins added to Neo4j.

In the first part of the context, it's about Neo4j itself, specifically mentioning that Cypher is its graph query language. Then in another part, under ""Query Language and Plugins,"" it states: ""Cypher - Awesome Procedures on Cypher - Add-on library that provides hundreds of procedures and functions."" So that clearly indicates that Cypher was developed for the purpose of querying graphs.

I don't recall Neo4j making any other databases or systems before this mention. The documents also talk about graph data models, transactional and analytical processing, ACID compliance, and distributed computing support. However, none of these details affect how Cypher was originally intended to be used as a query language. It's specifically attributed to the purpose of querying graphs.

Therefore, putting it all together, Cypher, which is part of Neo4j's graph query language, was invented when it was developed for this specific purpose, most likely around 2011 given that it was introduced in the 2nd section under Cypher. I don't think there were any other notable developments or versions before that.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was introduced around 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Hmm, the context provided seems to talk about various aspects of Neo4j and similar noSQL databases. Let me read through it again.

From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Cypher and Neo4j's graph query language): It mentions that Neo4j's graph query language is created in 2011. So the answer must be around 2011.

Looking at other sources like the Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf or the Adding an Edge with NoVariableNames.pdf, they all reference the ACID compliance and support for directed relationships, which aligns with Cypher being used as a query language in Neo4j. So combining this information from multiple sources leads me to believe that Cypher was introduced in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was invented in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by going through the context provided and see if there are any mentions of Neo4j itself.

Looking at the context, it starts with a PDF about Neo4j from page 2, which is talking about Cypher, the query language. Then later on in the same document, under the section ""Graph Data Model,"" it refers to MongoDB as an example. So that's not Neo4j.

Next, there are several other PDFs that discuss NoSQL databases and different graph-related systems like CosmoDB and Neptune. They all mention how Neo4j was developed before. The introduction talks about how Neo4j is a newer graph database compared to NoSQL databases which were around for a while.

In the section titled ""Adding an Edge with No Variable Names,"" it shows how nodes can be connected with relationships using directed edges, as per the documentation. So this also indicates that Neo4j uses a specific query language called Cypher or something similar, but I don't see any references to Neo4j's own name being used there.

The last PDF mentioned is an introduction to graph data model by Mark Fontenot from Northeastern University. That doesn't mention Neo4j either.

Looking back at the context, the most relevant part is where it talks about Cypher in the Cypher section. It says that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011 and provided a visual way to match patterns and relationships. Then later, under ""Graph Data Model,"" it mentions MongoDB as an example of a graph database service.

So putting this together, Neo4j introduced Cypher, which is the graph query language. However, the answer provided earlier refers to when Cypher was invented but also notes that Neo4j itself wasn't explicitly named in the context. The closest thing is that it's related to cypher, and I should mention both.

Wait, looking back at the initial query: ""When was neo4j's graph query language invented?"" Since Neo4j is a tool for building graphs, its graph query language would be Cypher or something similar. But in the context given, the main point about Cypher is that Neo4j introduced it in 2011 as part of their goal to provide a visual way to match patterns and relationships.

So maybe the answer should state when Cypher was invented and mention Neo4j's role in this by providing that query language. I think that's what the initial answer did but phrased it differently. However, since the context doesn't directly talk about Neo4j's introduction of any specific system, except for mentioning cypher as a tool they created.

So perhaps I should stick with the information given and say that Neo4j introduced Cypher in 2011 as part of their graph query language goal.

Neo4j introduced Cypher, a graph query language, in 2011. This was part of their vision to provide a visual way to match patterns and relationships, supporting both transactional and analytical processing.
