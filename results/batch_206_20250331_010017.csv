I don't know. The provided context appears to be about data replication, monotonic read consistency, observations on arrays and linked lists, binary search trees, isolation in relational databases, and optimistic concurrency. None of these topics seem directly related to AVL trees or their imbalances that require multiple rotations. Therefore, I do not have the information necessary to answer your query accurately.|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant. 
Use the following context to answer the query as accurately as possible. If the context is 
not relevant to the query, say 'I don't know'."|What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?
I don't know. The provided context does not contain information about AVL trees or their imbalances, nor does it discuss rotation operations. The topics covered include data replication, relational databases, NoSQL databases, and AWS services like EC2 and Lambda. Therefore, I am unable to provide a relevant answer to this query.|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The provided context does not seem to be relevant to the query about AVL trees and their rotation mechanisms. The context appears to be focused on NoSQL databases, concurrency control, data replication, and other related topics. There is no mention of AVL trees or their properties in the given text.|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
