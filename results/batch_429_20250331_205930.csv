"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the sequence of events or states an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through during its lifetime. According to the information on page 4 of the PDF, the EC2 lifecycle includes:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These lifecycle events allow you to manage your EC2 instances effectively, whether it's for web hosting, data processing, machine learning, or disaster recovery purposes (as mentioned on page 6 of the PDF)."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, specifically from page 4 of ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf"", the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages an instance goes through during its lifetime:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance, allowing you to restart it later.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance, which can be useful when no longer needed or when migrating data to another instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.

These lifecycle stages allow you to manage your EC2 instances according to your needs, from launching new instances to shutting them down when they're no longer required."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
