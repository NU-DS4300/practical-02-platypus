Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. Let me start by going through the context provided. 

First, in the NoSQL section, it mentions Redis as an in-memory database system with durability features like saving snapshots or being append-only. It also talks about Redis being open-source and supporting various models beyond just KV stores, including graphs, time series, vectors, etc.

Looking at the more specific sections, there's a part discussing Redis DB, which is a KV store, but I'm not exactly sure what other data types it supports. The context doesn't specify that further. 

Then, in the NoSQL section, page 19 mentions Redis Data Types Keys: - usually strings but can be any binary sequence Values: - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets (unique unsorted string elements) - Sorted Sets - Hashes (string â†’ string) - Geospatial data. So that's about keys and values in a set, not types of storage.

The section on Redis Database and Interaction talks about supporting various models like KV, Graph, etc., but it doesn't list specific value types beyond the one mentioned earlier. 

In the Python section from 06, they mention that Redis-py is maintained by Redis and is used for Python. It also references a Conda environment setup, which probably includes Redis modules.

So putting this together: Redis supports keys (which can be any binary sequence) as values in sets. It's used with multiple models beyond KV stores. The context doesn't list all the value types it supports directly, but since it mentions that Redis DB is a KV store, the main data type for storage would be strings, lists of strings, and sets of strings.

Wait, looking back at page 19: Keys are binary sequences, values can be strings or any binary sequence. So in terms of value types within Redis, they're not specified beyond what's said about keys and their associated value types. However, since the context mentions that the KV model supports lists and sets, which contain various types like strings, but it doesn't list each specific type.

So maybe I should just say that Redis supports key-value pairs where keys can be any binary sequence and values can be a wide range of data types, including strings, lists (which might hold arrays of objects), sets (which are unordered unique collections), etc., as specified in the context. It's more about how it's used for different models beyond just KV stores.

Redis supports key-value pairs where keys are any binary sequence and values can be a variety of data types. The context indicates that values include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which map keys to specific values), and geospatial data. Redis is primarily used in the KV store model but supports multiple database models beyond this."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values based on the provided context. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the NoSQL section, there's a chunk about Redis Data Types Keys and Values. It mentions that Redis primarily supports KV stores but can be used with other models like graphs or full text search. The list includes strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. It also notes that Redis doesn't handle complex data well, only supporting lookup by key.

Then, in the NoSQL Intro section, it says Redis is an in-memory database system. It mentions durability through snapshots or append-only files that can be rolled forward if there's a failure. It also talks about being open-source, primarily for KV stores but applicable to other models like graphs and text.

The DB section states that Redis is a remote directory server, open-source, maintained by the company itself, with a GitHub repo called redis/redis-py. It mentions it's used as a Python client in a 4300 Conda Environment package, which suggests it's compatible with Python-based tools.

Looking at the Data Interaction section, Redis provides 16 default databases and allows direct interaction through commands related to setting and getting K/V pairs, along with variations. There are also language libraries available. The Key-Value data model is central here since that's where I'm interested in.

Putting it all together, Redis supports several key-value types: strings (as keys or values), lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes as functions returning strings, and geospatial data with similarity values. It doesn't handle complex data structures beyond this core model.
</think>

Redis supports the following data types for values:

1. **Strings**: Both keys and values can be strings.
2. **Lists**: Lists are supported, which are linked lists of elements.
3. **Sets**: Redis supports sets, which contain unique unsorted string elements.
4. **Sorted Sets**: These are sets with elements ordered.
5. **Hashes (Hash Maps)**: Hashes return strings as values.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Geospatial data is supported with a similarity value.

Redis does not handle complex data structures beyond the core key-value model, offering durability through snapshots and append-only files that can be rolled forward in case of failures."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for holding values. From the context provided, there's a document about Redis in-depth, and another from a PDF file that's part of the same context. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the first PDF file on Redis Data Types. It mentions that Redis uses a key-value model, where each value is associated with a unique key. The values can be various types like strings, lists, sets, etc. So I can note those down as possible supported data types.

Then there's another PDF document which seems to focus on Redis DB, explaining how it's used for different data models and the ranking of KV stores among others. This doesn't directly address the value types, so maybe that's less relevant for this query about values.

Looking at the second PDF file from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf, it talks about Redis-py being a Python client library. It mentions that Redis supports various data structures and provides language libraries. The context also brings up an answer that Redis has 16 databases by default with no other names associated. So I think this reinforces the idea that there are multiple databases available.

However, since the query is specifically about the data types supported by Redis for values, I should focus on where that information is. The first PDF seems to give clear definitions of what Redis supports as values in its key-value model.

Also, considering the second document which lists 16 default Redis databases, it shows that Redis offers multiple implementations but not just one type of database. This might be useful if someone wants more diversity in their environment, but again, for the query about value types, I'll stick to what's directly stated in the first PDF.

I remember from earlier knowledge that Redis typically supports a range of data types, including strings, numbers, dates, geohash, and custom objects. It's important to note that some commands can handle more complex data structures beyond simple key-value pairs, but the primary value type is consistent across all operations, which is what the first PDF describes.

In conclusion, I'll outline Redis's supported values as strings, lists, sets, hashes (which are strings mapped to strings), and geospatial data with similarity. This covers the main points from the provided context without getting sidetracked into other types mentioned elsewhere.
</think>

Redis supports a variety of data types for holding values, which include:

1. **Strings**: Used for text data, dates, and identifiers.
2. **Lists**: Organized as linked lists to store multiple values.
3. **Sets**: Unique, unsorted elements stored in a hash-based structure.
4. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Map keys to values using strings as keys.
5. **Geospatial Data**: Represented with geohash formats for location data.

These data types are fundamental to Redis's key-value model, allowing it to handle diverse data structures effectively."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
