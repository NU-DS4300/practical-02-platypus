Alright, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From what I know, the user provided a context that mentions Cypher and adds some plugins. Let me see... The context talks about how the graph query language is similar to SQL but visual with patterns and relationships. It also introduces Apocrypse as a plugin.

Wait, the key term here is ""Cypher."" So if Neo4j uses Cypher for queries, that must be when it was designed or created. The user's question is about the invention of the graph query language. I'm thinking, did Neo4j invent the language itself, or was it just using existing terms?

Hmm, since Neo4j introduced Cypher as a way to interact with its data model, and given that it's part of a graph database ecosystem, it might be that they adapted an existing term like SQL for the graph version. So maybe the query language is called ""Cypher"" because it's the graph equivalent, not necessarily invented by Neo4j.

So putting it together, Neo4j likely uses Cypher as its graph query language name because of its design to handle graphs efficiently and visually. Therefore, Neo4j itself wasn't invented with a new query language; instead, they adopted an existing term.
</think>

Neo4j was not invented by the company but rather introduced the ""Cypher"" language as part of their graph database ecosystem. Cypher is used for querying its data model, drawing on the concept of SQL but adapted to handle graphs efficiently and visually.

**Answer:** Neo4j did not invent a graph query language; instead, they used an existing term like Cypher to denote their approach in graph databases."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From what I remember, the context provided mentions that the document is about the history of Neo4j, specifically the Cypher query language. It says that it was created in 2011 and that there are several plugins like APOC and the Graph Data Science plugin that add more features. But none of this directly mention when the Cypher itself was invented.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The user is asking about when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Since the context doesn't specify that it does, perhaps I should explain that while the specific Cypher syntax might be from a later period, the overall concept of a graph query language in databases does exist.

I recall that early database systems did have some kind of querying mechanisms, especially for complex queries like joins and aggregate functions. But Neo4j's introduction was more about using Cypher as its main query language. So maybe I can say that Neo4j introduced the Cypher syntax around 2011, but the concept of a graph query language in general predates that.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to when Cypher was first published or introduced into the system, which would be around that same year. But since they're asking about Neo4j's introduction, I think it's more accurate to say that Neo4j was introduced with Cypher in 2011, and thus its graph query language was created that year.
</think>

Neo4j was introduced with the Cypher query language in 2011. Therefore, the Cypher query language, which is part of Neo4j's graph query language, was invented around the time of its introduction into the system. 

**Answer:** Neo4j introduced its Cypher query language in 2011."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From what I remember, Neo4j is a graph database, and it has this Cypher query language built into it. The user provided some context about Neo4j, including the creation of Cypher in 2011 and various plugins like APOC and Graph Data Science. They also mentioned that the answer was around July 2011.

I know that Cypher is a high-level declarative query language specifically designed for graph databases. Before 2011, I don't recall any major developments in graph query languages within Neo4j. The first version of Neo4j might have started using older query languages or simpler structures, but Cypher was introduced in 2011.

The user's question is about the invention of Neo4j's graph query language. So, the answer would be that Cypher, which forms part of the graph query language, was invented around 2011. It's important to note that while there might have been previous attempts or implementations before 2011, the specific development and creation of Cypher as a standalone language came in 2011.

I should make sure I'm not conflating other languages with Neo4j. Some databases have their own proprietary query languages, but Neo4j's main graph database operations are handled through its Cypher dialect. So, Cypher was invented in 2011 to facilitate querying graphs efficiently.

The graph query language invented by Neo4j is Cypher, which was developed around **July 2011**."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
