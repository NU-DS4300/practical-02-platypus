Alright, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, especially the sections about Redis, it seems like Redis is a very in-memory database by default and provides multiple configurations for different use cases.

Looking at the first section from page 22 of the document, I see that Redis offers 16 default databases. The numbering goes from 0 to 15. This is mentioned in the context as ""16 databases by default."" 

Additionally, the second paragraph on page 17 talks about Redis being a KV store, which can be used with other models like graph and time series data, but that's not relevant here.

The third section from page 23 mentions that Redis provides 16 databases. It then explains how it supports durability of data by saving snapshots to disk or appending-only files that are journals for roll-forward operations. However, this doesn't change the number of supported databases.

I should also check if there's any mention of other configurations besides the default 16. Scanning through the text, it does not provide information about additional configurations or variations beyond the 16 defaults mentioned earlier. So, based on the provided context, Redis supports exactly 16 databases by default.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by looking through the context provided. 

From the first section on page 22, it says that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. There's no other name associated with them. So that's a key point.

Then, in another part (page 17), it mentions Redis is an open-source in-memory database system and primarily functions as a KV store but can be used with various models like graphs or full-text search. But the main focus here was on the number of default databases Redis supports.

Looking at the other sections, some talk about Redis commands and data types, and others discuss distributed systems and Docker setup. They also mention Redis in context 13 which is similar to the first part, reinforcing that it's a single-value store without complex indexing.

So putting this all together, Redis by default supports 16 databases, each numbered from 0 to 15.
</think>

Redis supports 16 default databases, numbered from 0 to 15. These are primarily used as KV stores and can be adapted for other models. Each database is identified by a unique number.

**Answer:** Redis supports 16 databases, numbered 0 through 15."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, let me try to figure out how many databases Redis supports. I'm looking at the context provided and trying to extract relevant information.

First, I see a section about Redis Database and Interaction where it mentions Redis provides 16 databases by default. The numbers go from 0 to 15. It also talks about direct interaction through commands like setting and getting k/v pairs, mentioning durability aspects with snapshots or append-only files.

Then in another part, there's information on Redis Data Types Keys. They list types including strings, lists, sets, etc., but it doesn't mention the number of databases.

I don't see any other mentions of Redis supporting multiple databases except for the 16 mentioned earlier. So, based on that, Redis supports 16 distinct databases.
</think>

Redis supports a total of **16 databases** by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
