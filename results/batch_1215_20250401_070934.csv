"According to the provided context from slides 05 and 06, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

These are the value data types mentioned in the slides as being supported by Redis."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context and my expertise in NoSQL databases, I can confidently answer that Redis supports the following data types for values:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

These data types are mentioned in the context on page 19 of the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" file, which states that Redis values can be Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, or Hashes.

Additionally, the example code provided in the ""Redis + Python.pdf"" file (page 5) demonstrates the use of strings as values using the `mset` and `mget` commands."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
