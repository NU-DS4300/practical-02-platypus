Okay, so I need to figure out which data types Redis supports for values based on the context provided. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the part about Redis Data Types Keys and Values, it says that Redis primarily handles KV stores, but can be used with other models like graphs or full text search. The values are described as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, etc., with some similarity scores. So for this section, I think the main value types Redis supports are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes.

Next, the document talks about Redis as an in-memory database system, mentioning durability through snapshots or journaling. It mentions Redis is open-source and can handle various models like geospatial data 20). But it doesn't directly address the values it supports here; it's more about how it stores data for durability.

Then, under Redis DB section, it says Redis provides 16 databases by default with no other names associated. It also mentions Redis-py being used as a Python client and that Conda Environment has it installed. This is about its popularity in Python but doesn't specify the value types.

The last part describes direct interaction with Redis via commands for KV pairs or other models, with many libraries available. Again, this section isn't directly addressing values, focusing on how to interact with Redis.

Putting all together: The only section explicitly mentions value types is the first one. So I should reference that. I'll include that and make sure it's accurate.

The primary data types Redis supports for values are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data 20).

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. From the context provided, it seems like there's a lot of information about Redis as an in-memory database system. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the part where it talks about Redis databases, it mentions that Redis primarily functions as a KV store, which stands for Key-Value store. It says Redis can handle various data structures like graphs and time series but mainly uses key-value pairs. That suggests that values in Redis are typically stored as key-value pairs.

Next, I remember reading that Redis doesn't directly support complex data structures like geospatial or full texts. Instead, it's focused on simpler types such as strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which are unordered unique collections), and hashes (which map keys to values). These are all common in databases for efficiently storing and retrieving data.

The context also mentions that Redis doesn't handle secondary indexes beyond the primary key. This is an important point because having a primary key can improve query performance by allowing faster lookups when stored in indexed databases, but without it, queries remain based on the primary key.

Looking at some specific commands from the documentation, like r.set(), r.get(), r.mset(), and r.mget(), these functions seem to handle various data types. For example, mset is used for setting multiple values under a key, and mget returns all values associated with that key. This confirms that Redis can manage different data types such as strings, lists of strings, sets of unique strings, hashes mapping keys to string values.

The part about the ranking of KV stores mentions that Redis primarily functions as a KV store but supports graphs and other models, so it's not limited to only storing simple data structures. However, for value storage, the focus is still on key-value pairs with the specified types mentioned earlier.

Additionally, when I check some documentation links, I see examples where values are stored as strings, lists of strings, sets of unique strings, and hashes mapping keys to string values. There's no mention of binary sequences or other complex data structures here, which aligns with what I remember about Redis being more suited for simple data types.

Putting this all together, it seems clear that Redis primarily uses key-value pairs where the value can be a string, list (which is essentially an array), set (which is unordered and unique collections of strings), or hash (which maps keys to string values). It doesn't support other complex data structures like geospatial data or full texts unless specified, as mentioned in the context.

I also notice that some commands like mset are used for setting multiple values at once, and mget retrieves all associated values. This indicates that Redis can handle various types of collections efficiently by grouping keys under a single key, which is typical for KV stores.

In summary, based on the information provided, Redis supports several data types primarily in key-value pairs, including strings, lists, sets, and hashes. It doesn't store complex data structures beyond these simple types without specific commands or features.
</think>

Redis primarily functions as a Key-Value Store (KV) database with a focus on storing key-value pairs. It supports the following data types for values:

1. **Strings**: Directly supported as values in key-value pairs.
2. **Lists (Array)**: Collections of key-value pairs, where each value is a string.
3. **Sets**: Unordered, unique collections of strings, which can be accessed by their keys.
4. **Hashes (Mappings)**: Maps keys to string values, essential for efficient lookups when using Redis as an in-memory database.

Redis does not support complex data structures like geospatial or full texts directly but focuses on managing key-value pairs with these types."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with page 19 of NoSQL Intro, it says that Redis is an in-memory database system and supports durability. It mentions snapshots are saved at specific intervals or used as a journal that can be rolled forward if there's a failure. The data types supported include strings, lists (as linked lists), sets (which are unique unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes (which map from strings to strings), and geospatial data with similarity 436.20.

Next, looking at page 18 of NoSQL Intro, it talks about Redis being fast, with 100,000 set operations per second. It mentions a rich collection of commands but doesn't mention data types, so maybe that section isn't directly relevant.

The DB section on page 17 mentions Redis as a KV store that can also be used for other models like graphs, spatial, time series, etc., and it's often referred to as an in-memory database. It lists the supported commands related to setting and getting K/V pairs or variations.

In Redis-py.pdf on pages 22-23, Redis is introduced as a Python client, maintained by Redis itself, available under a Conda environment. The page doesn't mention data types per se, so maybe this isn't directly helpful for the query about supported values.

Looking at Redis in Context 13 (page 13), it's mentioned that Redis has multiple built-in data types like integers, floats, booleans, dates, etc., which are used as keys. There's also a section on how to create custom data types, but that's more for advanced users.

In the DS/ML section from MADMA ML (page 14), it talks about Redis in DS/ML and how to store data using Redis commands like set, mset, get, etc., supporting various keys. This again doesn't directly answer the query on supported values but is part of a broader context.

Finally, Redis in Context 15 from MADMA ML (page 15) explains that Redis supports custom data types as keys and provides methods for storing and retrieving them. The section also mentions commands like mset, mget, etc., which support different key types.

Putting it all together, the main points are: Redis supports strings, lists (as linked lists), sets (unique unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes (strings to strings), and geospatial data with similarity. The other sections might not add much to this query.
</think>

The supported data types in Redis for values include:

1. Strings
2. Lists (as linked lists)
3. Sets (unsorted unique strings)
4. Sorted Sets (pre-1.5)
5. Hashes (strings to strings)
6. Geospatial data with similarity 436.20

These data types are used as keys in Redis for efficient value storage and retrieval, supported through various commands like mset, mget, and others."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
