Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking me to name the data types supported by Redis for values based on a given context. They provided a PDF snippet from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" which discusses Redis data types.

First, I need to understand what exactly the user wants. They want the specific data types Redis uses for storing and retrieving values. The context mentions Redis Data Types Keys with several examples: strings, lists (linked lists), sets (unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes (string → string), and geospatial data.

The query is pretty straightforward—identifying which data types Redis supports for storing values. From the context, I see that it's clear that Redis uses strings as the primary type of value storage. It also mentions lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data, but those are more about how Redis structures data rather than what types it stores.

I should ensure my answer accurately reflects this information without mentioning any other languages or systems mentioned in the context. Since the query is specific to Redis's value storage, I'll stick strictly to Redis-related terms.

Putting it all together, the supported values for Redis are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. These make up the data types Redis uses.

The data types Redis supports for storing values include:

- **Strings**: The primary type of value storage.
- **Lists**: Collections of items.
- **Sets**: Unique elements in an unsorted structure.
- **Sorted Sets**: Maintained in a sorted manner.
- **Hashes (keyed hashes)**: Maps keys to string values, often used for fast lookups.
- **Geospatial Data**: Includes points, line strings, polygons, and other spatial data types.

These are the data types Redis utilizes for storing value information."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out how to answer this query accurately using the given context. The user is asking to name the data types supported by Redis for values.

Looking at the context, it's a PDF document about NoSQL intro and KV DBs. On page 19, there's a section discussing Redis Data Types Keys. It lists several keys: Strings, Lists (which are linked lists), Sets (which are unordered but unique), Sorted Sets, and Geospatial data with 20 entries.

Wait, the query is specifically about values for the data types. So I should focus on the 'Values' part of each key listed in the context. The keys are Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, and Geospatial data. Each of these has a corresponding value type: Strings, Lists, Sets (unique), Sorted Sets, and Geospatial.

Therefore, the data types supported for values in Redis would include all these listed under 'Values' from each key.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values are:

- **Strings**: Any binary sequence
- **Lists**: Linked lists
- **Sets**: Unordered unique string elements (note: Sets may not be sorted)
- **Sorted Sets**: Sorted unique string elements
- **Hashes**: String → String transformations
- **Geospatial data**: Includes geospatial information with specific similarity settings"|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query about the data types in Redis used for storing values. The user gave me a context that talks about Redis Data Types Keys, and it lists several things like strings, lists, sets, etc., but all under ""Values."" The query is specifically asking for the data types supported by Redis for values.

First, I should make sure I understand what's being asked. They want to know which types of data can be stored in Redis containers as values. From the context provided, it seems that the example lists several like strings, lists, sets, etc., but all are under ""Values.""

I should check if there's any other information about this from the context. The context mentions that some values include ""Hashes"" which map to strings and geospatial data with similarity metrics. That suggests that even though they're called 'hashes,' they still represent data in a specific format.

So, for the answer, I should list all the Redis Data Types Keys under ""Values."" They have listed them as:

- Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial data 20) with similarity 133.24

But wait, the context was from a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf."" That might give more context on why these specific types are used for values in NoSQL databases like Redis.

In the context, it says: Values - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets (unique unsorted string elements) - Sorted Sets - Geospatial data 20) with similarity 133.24

So those seem to be the primary value types for Redis. However, I should also remember that there might be other data types used in practice or different names when translated into SQL or other languages.

I think the user wants a clear list of these values, so I'll structure it similarly to what's provided but make sure all are included without any extra information beyond what's in the context.
