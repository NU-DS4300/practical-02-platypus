"According to the context provided, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various stages that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through. These stages include:

1. Launch - This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. Start/Stop - This stage involves temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance. You can stop an instance and then start it again to conserve resources or perform maintenance tasks.
3. Terminate - In this stage, you permanently delete the instance, effectively destroying all associated data and configurations.
4. Reboot - This is a process that restarts an instance without losing any data stored on the root volume."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"According to the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various states that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can be in. These states include:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This state allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: In this state, the instance is permanently deleted.
4. **Reboot**: This option restarts an instance without affecting data on the root volume.

These lifecycle states allow you to manage your EC2 instances effectively and control their usage."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that:

The EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages or states through which an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes during its lifetime. These stages are:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This stage allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance, effectively putting it into a ""pause"" mode.
3. **Terminate**: In this final stage, the instance is permanently deleted.
4. **Reboot**: This stage restarts an instance without affecting the data on its root volume.

So, that's the EC2 lifecycle in a nutshell!"|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
