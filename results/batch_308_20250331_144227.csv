"I must say that the context provided is not directly related to AVL trees or their imbalances. However, I'll do my best to answer the query based on my understanding of data engineering and databases.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, which means it's designed to maintain balance between its left and right subtrees after each insertion or deletion operation. An imbalance in an AVL tree typically occurs when the difference between the height of the left and right subtrees exceeds a certain threshold (usually 1).

To rebalance the tree, one or more rotations are performed to restore the balance property. There are two types of rotations: Left-Rotate and Right-Rotate.

Multiple rotations may be required in an AVL tree if:

1. **Left-heavy node**: When a left-heavy node is inserted, multiple rotations might be necessary to rebalance the tree.
2. **Right-heavy node**: Similarly, when a right-heavy node is inserted, multiple rotations might be needed to restore balance.
3. **Insertion/deletion sequence**: A sequence of insertions or deletions can lead to an imbalanced tree, requiring multiple rotations to rebalance it.

In summary, multiple rotations in an AVL tree are typically required when dealing with left- or right-heavy nodes or complex insertion/deletion sequences that disrupt the balance property.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure, and it's designed to maintain a balance between the heights of its left and right subtrees. Imbalances in an AVL tree can occur when the height difference between the two child nodes becomes too large. There are three types of imbalances that require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-left imbalance**: When a node has two child nodes, both of which are left-leaning (i.e., their heights are larger than the parent's height), an additional rotation is needed to balance the tree.
2. **Right-right imbalance**: Similarly, when a node has two right-leaning child nodes, another rotation is required to restore balance.
3. **Left-right or Right-left imbalance**: In cases where a node has one left-leaning and one right-leaning child node, multiple rotations are necessary to achieve balance.

These imbalances can be resolved through a combination of left and right rotations, ensuring that the AVL tree remains balanced and efficient for search operations.

"I'd be happy to help! However, I must say that the context provided has no relevance to the query about AVL trees. The context appears to be discussing the limitations and challenges of relational databases, while the query is asking about AVL trees.

That being said, I'll do my best to answer the question regardless.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure. In an AVL tree, each node has at most two children (i.e., left child and right child). The key property of an AVL tree is that it remains approximately balanced, which means that the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for any given node.

There are two types of imbalances that can occur in an AVL tree:

1. Left-heavy imbalance: This occurs when the left subtree of a node is significantly taller than its right subtree.
2. Right-heavy imbalance: This occurs when the right subtree of a node is significantly taller than its left subtree.

When these imbalances occur, multiple rotations may be required to restore the balance property of the AVL tree. The type and number of rotations needed depend on the specific imbalance and the structure of the tree.

In general, there are three types of rotations that can be used to rebalance an AVL tree:

1. Left rotation: This involves rotating a node to the left, effectively making its right child its new parent.
2. Right rotation: This involves rotating a node to the right, effectively making its left child its new parent.
3. Double rotation: This involves performing both a left and a right rotation on a node.

The specific rotations required depend on the type and extent of the imbalance. If the imbalance is mild, a single rotation may be sufficient. However, if the imbalance is more severe, multiple rotations (including double rotations) may be needed to restore balance to the tree.
