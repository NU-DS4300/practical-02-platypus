Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was actually released. Let me look through the context provided and see if I can find any information about its release date.

First, scanning the context, I notice a few sections that mention Redis. In page 17 of the first document from NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, it says: ""Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database - Sometimes called a data structure store - Primarily a KV store, but can be used with other models: Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, Time Series."" This seems to indicate that Redis was introduced as an open-source in-memory database.

Looking at the subsequent documents from 05 and 06, I don't see any information about Redis's release date. The first document (page 18) doesn't mention Redis at all; it talks about other topics like durability of data storage. The second document (page 17) also mentions Redis as a KV store but doesn't provide details on its introduction.

In the third document, from NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf again, page 17, the same thing happens. There's no mention of Redis being released or when it was introduced. The next document from 05 (page 18) discusses durability but doesn't address Redis further. Similarly, in 06, there are mentions of Redis-py and other components but no release date.

Additionally, the fourth document (from 06) on page 12 also references Redis in a section titled ""Redis in Context 13,"" which again doesn't provide any information about its introduction or release date. The fifth document from 06 mentions Redis being part of the Python ecosystem on page 14 and includes details about Redis-py, but no release date.

Finally, when I look at the last source provided (https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/) from 06, it discusses Redis in a machine learning context, but again, no information about its release.

Putting all this together, the only direct mention of Redis is in the first document where it's mentioned as an open-source in-memory database. However, none of the following documents provide specific years or months when Redis was released. It seems that Redis might have been around since the early 2000s and could be available before the other topics discussed here.

Therefore, based on the context provided, there is no explicit information about when Redis was actually released. The information given pertains to its use as a KV store in various contexts but doesn't include release details.

The context does not provide specific information about when Redis was released. Redis has been referenced in discussions of data structures and other topics, indicating it might have been around before the provided documents were written.

Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant section step by step.

First, I see a section from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" where it mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system but supports durability features like snapshots or append-only files for roll-back failures. It also says it was developed in 2009 in C++. 

Looking at another section under the same file, there's a bullet point with ""Originally developed in 2009 in C++."" That gives me an indication that Redis was created around that time.

Then, I check other sections from the same file. There are mentions of Redis being used with Python and ML, which are modern programming languages but don't change its origin date. Similarly, the section on Redis in DS/ML refers to it as a standard client for Python, reinforcing that it's an older tool.

All these sources point back to Redis being introduced around 2009. The other sections about KV stores and how Redis can handle complex data with limited support don't affect its release date.
</think>

The query asks when Redis was released. Based on the context provided:

1. **NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf** mentions Redis was developed in 2009 in C++.
2. Additional sections (e.g., Redis + Python.pdf) reference Redis as an older tool, but they don't provide a release date beyond 2009.

Therefore, Redis was released in **2009**.

Answer: Redis was introduced in 2009."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was actually released. Let's see... The query is ""When was Redis released?"" and the answer provided is a bit long with chunks from different documents.

Looking at the context, there are multiple PDFs about Redis. From 05, it's about NoSQL Intro and KV DBs, where it mentions Redis being in-memory. It also says that Redis was originally developed in 2009 by C++. So that gives a date range of 2009 to perhaps 2014 when Redis started gaining traction.

The other document from 06 is about Redis in Python, which doesn't mention the release date but likely came after 2009. Also, the query might be looking for when Redis was released as a product, so combining these documents, I think Redis was around starting in late 2008 or early 2009.
