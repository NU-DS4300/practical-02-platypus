"According to the provided context from page 4 of ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf"", the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various states that an EC2 instance can be in, which are:

* Launch: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
* Start/Stop: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
* Terminate: Permanently deleting the instance.
* Reboot: Restarting an instance without affecting data on the root volume.

These states allow you to manage and control your EC2 instances as needed."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"Based on the provided context from the ""EC2 & Lambda"" document, I can answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages or states that an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through during its lifetime. These stages are:

1. **Launch**: When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.

These stages are mentioned in the context from page 4 of the document, which is highlighted as having a similarity score of 0.21."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"According to the provided context, specifically from page 4 of ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf"", the EC2 lifecycle involves the following stages:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.

These stages provide a comprehensive overview of the EC2 lifecycle, allowing users to manage and utilize their instances effectively in the cloud."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
