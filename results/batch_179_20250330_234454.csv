Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for values based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.

First, there's a section about Redis Data Types Keys and Values. It mentions that values can be strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which have unique elements), sorted sets, hashes (where keys map to values as strings), and geospatial data with similarity. The numbers in parentheses probably indicate their rankings or something related, but I'm not sure if that's relevant for the question.

Next, there's a part about Redis Database and Interaction which lists 16 default databases by number from 0 to 15. It also mentions that Redis can be used as a KV store or with other models like graphs, spatial, full text search, etc. So Redis isn't just for key-value pairs but has various extensions.

Then there's a section on Redis Command List which includes a filter to find commands related to specific data structures. I'm not sure how detailed this is beyond the initial list provided in pages 2 and 3 of that document.

Looking at page 18, it says Redis supports durability with snapshots or an append-only file for roll-forward if there's a failure. It also mentions Redis supports very fast operations like 100,000 SET operations per second and lacks secondary indexes, only supporting lookup by key.

The last part of the query just says ""Name the data types supported by Redis for values."" So I need to focus on the value support section. From the Data Types section, it lists strings, lists (linked lists), sets (unique unsorted elements), sorted sets, hashes (key-value pairs as strings), and geospatial data with similarity.

I should also consider if there are any other aspects related to values mentioned in the context that might be relevant. The Database part mentions it's used in various models but doesn't specify value support beyond what Redis itself supports.

Putting this together, I think the key points about Redis for values are strings, lists (which can have duplicates now since Redis 2.x added multiset support), sets, sorted sets, hashes as key-value pairs, and geospatial data. The other parts of the context might relate to how these values are managed in terms of durability or how Redis interacts with other databases.

Wait, but I'm not sure if sets have duplicates now or if they still support single values instead of multiple copies. From what I remember, Redis 2.x introduced multiset support for sets, which allows for duplicate elements. So that should be included as well.

So the data types supported by Redis for values are:
1. Strings
2. Lists (which can have duplicates now)
3. Sets (with or without duplicates, based on Redis version)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (key-value pairs where both keys and values are strings)

I think that's all from the context provided. The other aspects like durability and interaction with other databases might be more about how the database works together rather than what types it supports for values.

Redis supports several data types for storing values, which include:

1. **Strings**: These are straightforward and can handle any type of string data.

2. **Lists (or Linked Lists)**: Redis allows lists to contain duplicate elements as of Redis 2.x. This means that if you store the same value multiple times in a list, it's possible for duplicates to remain.

3. **Sets**: Sets in Redis support unique values and can handle duplicates since Redis 2.x introduced multiset mode where sets can store duplicate values by default.

4. **Sorted Sets**: These are sorted and do not allow duplicates unless specified otherwise.

5. **Hashes (Key-Value Pairs)**: Hashes in Redis map keys to string values, supporting both single-value hashes (when the value is a string) and multiple-value hashes where each key maps to its corresponding string value.

These data types cover a wide range of use cases from simple strings to complex key-value structures, leveraging Redis's efficient storage mechanisms."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out which data types Redis supports for storing values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and the different data types it handles.

First, from what I remember, Redis is mainly a KV store, but it can be used with other models like Graph, Geospatial, Vector, etc. But the question specifically asks about the data types supported for values, so I'll focus on that part.

Looking at the context provided, there are some sections talking about Redis databases and their interaction. One chunk mentions Redis Data Types: Keys and Values. It lists several types like strings, lists (linked lists), sets (which are unique unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes (string to string), and geospatial data with a similarity value.

Another section talks about Redis supporting durability of data by saving snapshots to disk or using an append-only file system for roll-forward. It also mentions Redis is an in-memory database but can handle very fast operations like 100,000 SET (set enrichment) operations per second and has rich commands without secondary indexes.

So, based on the first chunk's bullet points, the data types Redis supports include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes. The geospatial data part is more about similarity in its values, not a specific data type itself.

Wait, does Redis have any other data types? Let me check the context again. The only mention of another type was geospatial data with a similarity value, which is used to define relationships between different fields. So I think the main data types are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes.

I should make sure there aren't any other types mentioned or implied here. From what's provided, it seems these are the primary data types Redis supports for storing values. It doesn't mention anything else like dates (date-time), numbers, booleans, etc., so I think those are out of scope unless specified.

Redis supports several key data types for storing values, which include:

1. **Strings**: The basic type used for text or non-numeric values.
2. **Lists**: A collection of items where each item can be any value, linked as a sequence.
3. **Sets**: Unique elements from a list, with no duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but sorted, allowing efficient range queries and operations.
5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Maps keys to values using strings as keys or other data types.

Redis does not support additional data types beyond these specified types for storing values."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which data types Redis supports for values. From what I know, Redis is an in-memory database system that's often used as a language library because it can handle complex queries efficiently. The context provided includes some information about Redis and its commands, but I need to focus specifically on the data types it supports.

Looking at the context from page 19 of ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" it mentions that Redis has a collection called ""DB - Open source, in-memory database."" It talks about different data structures like KV store, graph, spatial, etc. But I'm interested in the values those databases hold.

In section 20, it says Redis provides 16 databases by default with numbers 0 to 15. The key point is that Redis primarily supports a ""KV"" store model, which means each value is associated with a key. However, Redis can also handle other data structures like geospatial data, graphs, etc., but the question specifically asks about the values.

The context from page 22 mentions Redis provides language libraries for various operations, including commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs. There's also a section on interaction with Redis mentioning direct commands for these operations. However, it doesn't explicitly list the data types supported by Redis in terms of types like strings or lists.

Wait, looking again at page 19, I see that under ""Values,"" Redis supports strings, lists (linked lists), sets (unique unsorted string elements), sorted sets, and hashes (string â†’ string). It also mentions geospatial data with similarity, which is more about spatial data types. 

Since the query is about data types supported by Redis for values, I think it's referring to the fundamental data types like strings, lists, etc., because these are the primary value types that work best with Redis's in-memory architecture.

So, putting it all together, Redis supports various value types such as strings, numbers (which can be represented as strings), booleans, dates/timestamps, and more complex structures. However, the specific commands like SET, LSET, SSET, etc., are designed to handle these basic data types.
</think>

Redis primarily supports several fundamental value types for its operations:

1. **Strings**: These include various formats such as numbers (converted to strings), special characters, and Unicode characters.
2. **Numbers**: Represented as strings or integers, Redis can also store floating-point numbers.
3. **Booleans**: Redis works with booleans as true/false values when converted from strings.
4. **Dates/Timestamps**: Supports dates and timestamps formatted in ISO or Unix/ Julian day formats.
5. **Lists**: A collection of items connected by references to form linked lists.

These types are essential for its data processing needs, leveraging Redis' efficient in-memory operations."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
