Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant section and see what information is given about Redis.

First, in the NoSQL Introduction section (page 22), it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So that's a clear indication of the number of databases. I should make sure there aren't any other contexts that might contradict this information or add more details.

Looking further down, in the ""Redis DB - Redis Data Structure Store"" section (page 17), it specifies that Redis is an open-source, in-memory database and can be used with various models like graphs, spatial data, etc. This doesn't change the number of databases it supports; it just explains how it's used.

Additionally, in the Connecting to the Server section (page 2), it talks about Docker deployment specifics, host addresses, ports, and database IDs. However, this is more about configuration than the actual number of supported databases. So it doesn't affect my answer on the number.

I don't see any other sections that provide information about Redis's database count beyond what's already mentioned in page 22. The other parts are about how to connect to the server and installing dependencies, which are standard for using Redis with Python but aren't directly related to the quantity of databases it supports.

So putting this together, the number of databases Redis supports is 16.

Alright, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me go through each chunk and see what information is relevant.

First, there's a chunk about Redis providing 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That seems clear enough; Redis has multiple in-memory databases accessible through specific IDs.

Another chunk mentions Redis as an in-memory database system that supports durability. It says they save snapshots at specific intervals or use an append-only file for roll-forward if there's a failure. This part is about how Redis handles data durability, but it doesn't mention the number of supported databases.

There's another section titled ""Redis DB"" which describes Redis as a data structure store that can be used in various models like KV stores, graphs, spatial, etc., and has features like time series and vector processing. Again, this is about its architecture and use cases but not on the number of databases it supports.

Then there's a file from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf which talks about connecting to Redis through Docker with host settings and using the redis library in Python. This part doesn't provide any information related to database count.

So, focusing back on the first chunk, it explicitly states that Redis provides 16 databases by default. The other chunks are either explaining features or using cases but don't add new information about the number of supported databases.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through each chunk carefully.

First, there's a chunk about Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. This seems straightforwardâ€”it directly states that there are 16 databases. So I should note that as 16.

Next, on another page, it mentions Redis is an in-memory database system but supports durability with specific methods: saving snapshots at intervals or append-only files for roll-forward. That doesn't mention the number of databases, so maybe this isn't relevant to the question about the count.

Looking further down, there's a section called ""Redis DB - Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database."" It mentions that Redis supports various models like KV store and others, but again, it doesn't specify the number of databases. So I shouldn't include this information unless it was part of the context.

The other sections talk about Docker deployment settings for connecting to Redis server, how to import Redis via Python, and details on Redis-py being maintained by the company itself. These don't provide numbers related to the count of supported databases.

So, focusing back, the main relevant info is that there are 16 databases numbered 0-15. The other chunks discuss features but not the number in question.
</think>

The context clearly states that Redis supports 16 databases, numbered from 0 to 15. This information is directly provided in the first chunk of the context.
