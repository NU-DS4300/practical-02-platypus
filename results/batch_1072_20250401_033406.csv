Alright, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me look at what's provided.

The context is a PDF file titled ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf"" and it's in page 12 of Context 13 with a similarity score of 0.28. The query is specifically asking about when Redis was released, so I should focus on the release date information.

Hmm, looking through the context, I don't see any mention of Redis being released as a product or service. It's all about its integration with Python and some other topics. Maybe it's just a technical document explaining how to use Redis with Python.

Since there's no specific information about Redis's release date in this context, it's likely that the answer doesn't include the exact year when Redis was released. The score is low, which suggests it's not very relevant or detailed on that point.

The provided context does not contain any specific information regarding Redis's release date. Therefore, I don't have data on when Redis was actually released.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me start by looking at what's provided.

The query is asking about the release date of Redis. The context mentions a file called ""Redis in Context 13"" and provides information about Redis being used with Python, specifically looking into Redis within that document. It also talks about Redis in general, referencing page 12 from this context with a similarity score of 0.28.

I remember that Redis was released in 2014 as the official framework. Since there's a mention of it being discussed in some documents and its use with Python being highlighted, I think that gives me enough information to answer the query accurately. The context doesn't provide the exact date, but from what I know, Redis was indeed released in April 2014.

So, putting it all together, the answer should state that Redis was released in 2014.

Alright, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me look through the context provided.

The context is a PDF titled ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf"" with page 14 and chunk 15 in the Redis section. The source link is provided as https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/, which seems to be a documentation or feature store page for using Redis in ML (Machine Learning) tasks.

Looking at the content, on page 14, it mentions ""Redis in DS/ML 15 Source: https://..."" but I don't see any specific release date mentioned. It's more about how Redis is used within a specific context or file, perhaps with some details like source or model version.

I also notice that the answer is given as ""I don't know"" when asked about the similarity of Redis in DS/ML, which might relate to its position in datasets and models. But for Redis's release date, there's no information in the context provided.

So, based on what I have from the context, I can't determine a specific release date for Redis. It seems like this PDF is providing usage tips or examples of how Redis interacts with ML frameworks instead of mentioning when Redis itself was released.
