Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, it looks like there's some information about Redis but not directly stating the number of supported databases. Let me go through the sections one by one.

Starting with the section on Redis DB 0-15, it says that Redis provides 16 databases by default. But wait, is that all? I mean, does Redis have any other related database types or services?

I remember seeing a part about Redis Data Types Keys which mentions keys can be strings but can also include lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. That seems to relate to how the client interacts with Redis databases, but it's not directly answering the number of supported databases.

Looking at the ""Ranking of KV Stores"" section, it ranks Redis among KV stores like MongoDB and MySQL, but that doesn't change the fact that Redis is a local in-memory database for key-value pairs. There are no other primary database services or libraries listed as supporting Redis apart from those related to data types.

There's also information about Redis being supported by multiple databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle, through the Redis driver in different languages (Java, C++, etc.). That doesn't affect the count of Redis itself but explains how it integrates with other systems.

The ""Ranking of Redis DBs"" section mentions Redis Data Types Keys, which are used to store data, so that's about how the client interacts with Redis databases, not the number of supported databases themselves.

So putting this all together, I don't see any information suggesting Redis supports more than 16 databases. The other sections discuss features and integration but don't add to the count of supported services. Therefore, Redis primarily supports 16 databases by default.

Redis primarily supports 16 databases as per its default configuration.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the section from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" around page 22. It mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. They don't mention any other names associated with them beyond their numbering. So that's a starting point.

Then, in the same document on pages 23-24, they talk about how Redis is an open-source in-memory database system that supports various models like KV store or even graphs and other structures. It also lists some key points: it's built by Redis, maintains itself as an open-source project, has a GitHub repository, and is referenced with a Conda environment.

Moving to the section from ""Redis + Python.pdf"" on page 2. There are two parts: the first discusses Redis-py being the standard client for Python, maintained by Redis and available in a specific Conda environment. The second part lists some commands under the Redis Command List, but it's not giving a direct answer to how many databases Redis supports.

In another section from ""Moving Beyond the Relational Model (1).pdf"" on page 17, they talk about distributed data stores that can be either relational or non-relational. They mention MySQL and PostgreSQL supporting replication and sharding, while CockroachDB is a new NoSQL system on the scene. This seems more about how Redis interacts with different systems rather than the number of databases it supports.

The query specifically asks: ""How many databases does Redis support?"" To answer this, I need to focus on where Redis is mentioned as providing multiple databases and not referring to anything else beyond that. In the first part, it clearly states there are 16 default databases. There's no mention of additional databases or any other systems besides Redis itself, so I can conclude that Redis supports 16 databases by default.

Redis supports **16 databases** by default, numbered from 0 to 15.

Alright, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me go through the provided text step by step.

First, in the section about Redis and KV DBs.pdf, page 22, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It also talks about direct interaction with Redis using commands related to k/v pairs and their variations. Then, on page 23, there's a paragraph discussing how many language libraries are available as well. So far, I see that the main point is that Redis has 16 databases.

Looking further down, in the same document (page 22), it clarifies that Redis is an open-source, in-memory database system designed for key-value stores but can be used with various models like graphs, spatial data, time series, etc. But I don't see any information about how many databases it supports beyond the 16 mentioned earlier.

Then, on page 17, there's another mention of Redis DB and the list of supported database types. It says that Redis supports KV stores but can be used with other models. However, this doesn't change the count of the number of databases; it just explains how it works with different data structures.

There's also a section about Redis Data Types on page 19, which lists keys, values, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. Again, this is about the data types, not the number of databases Redis supports.

On page 20, under Setting Up Redis in Docker, it explains how to set up Redis in Docker using a specific image, but again, that's more about the setup configuration rather than the count of databases.

Finally, on page 21, connecting from DataGrip - File > New > Data Source > Redis is mentioned as a method to connect. This section doesn't provide any additional information about the number of databases Redis supports beyond the initial paragraph.

So, putting it all together, Redis primarily supports 16 databases numbered from 0 to 15. The other sections seem to be detailed information about how these databases function or their types but don't add to the total count.

Redis supports a total of **16 databases**. These are identified by numbers from 0 to 15, as specified in the context provided."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
