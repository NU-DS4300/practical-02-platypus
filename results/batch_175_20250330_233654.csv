Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, I can see that there are several sources about Redis mentioned. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, looking at the link from page 22, it says Redis provides 16 databases by default with numbers 0 to 15. That seems clear. So, right away, I know Redis supports 16 different databases numbered from 0 to 15. 

Then there's another source on page 23 that mentions Redis is an open-source in-memory database and has a KV store model but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. But the main point here is still about the number of databases it supports. So even though it's versatile, the count remains at 16.

Looking further down the same page, I see it mentions that Redis supports durability features: a) saving snapshots to disk or b) append-only files which allow roll-forward if there's a failure. That's more about reliability but doesn't affect the database count.

Then on pages 17 and 18, the ranking of KV stores is given with Redis at position 18. This tells us that Redis is ranked among the best KV store implementations, but again, it doesn't change the fact that it supports 16 databases.

The next section talks about Redis's history—it was originally developed in C++ and has since been maintained by the company. It supports over 100 million set operations per second, which is a measure of its performance. The data structure it uses is an in-memory database, meaning it can handle large datasets without relying on disk storage.

In the Python section, Redis-py is highlighted as the standard client for Python. There's also a conda environment mentioned where it's included. This tells us about its integration capabilities but doesn't impact the number of databases it supports.

Looking at other sources from page 19, it details Redis data types which include strings, lists (linked lists), sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. Again, this is information about how to use Redis in programming but doesn't affect its database count.

Putting it all together, the main point in the context is that Redis supports 16 databases by default. The other sources are more about the features and usage of those databases or tools associated with Redis, which don't change the number of supported databases.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. These databases provide in-memory storage solutions that offer enhanced performance, durability, and flexibility compared to traditional in-memory systems like MongoDB."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, there's a PDF about Redis and some chunks that talk about its capabilities.

First, I see that one chunk mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15. Another chunk refers to Redis as an in-memory database system with durability features like snapshots and append-only files. It's also noted for being very fast at handling large operations like 100,000 SET operations per second.

Looking back, the main points are that Redis has 16 databases by default and it supports durability mechanisms which allow data to be rolled over if something goes wrong. The query is specifically about how many databases Redis supports, not the specific type of database or its durability features. So I focus on the first chunk, where it says there are 16 default databases.

I should double-check if there's any other mention of more or fewer databases. The other PDF mentions Redis as an open-source in-memory database with 18 ranking, but that's about ranking KV stores, which doesn't add up to a number of databases. That might be a mistake, but it's not related to the question.

So, putting it all together, Redis supports 16 databases by default. I don't see any other information in the context that mentions more than that.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me go through the context provided and see what information is relevant.

First, in the context about Redis (page 22), it says that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. They are numbered from 0 to 15. So that's a clear number there: 16.

Then on page 23, under the ""Direct interaction with Redis"" section, it mentions they support commands related to setting and getting KV pairs, which I think refers to key-value storage. It also talks about durability—basically, saving snapshots for data redundancy. But that doesn't directly answer how many databases Redis supports.

Looking further down on the same page, under ""Many language libraries available as well,"" it mentions they have libraries but doesn't specify how many databases they support beyond the 16 default ones mentioned earlier.

So putting it together, Redis has a total of 16 databases by default. The rest of the context discusses features like durability and language libraries but doesn't add more detail about database count.
