Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through each section and looking for any mentions of Redis.

First, there's a section from 05 titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf."" It says that Redis provides 16 databases by default. That seems important. Also, it mentions that these are numbered from 0 to 15. So that gives me 16 databases.

Then, in another file ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" there's a chunk about Redis being used in ML. The text here talks about Redis being the ""data store"" and mentioning things like simplified examples, but it doesn't explicitly state the number of databases. It just mentions how Redis supports various models like graph, spatial, etc., but I don't see any numbers mentioned.

The other sections, like the ones about durability of data in Redis, are more about its features rather than the count of supported databases. They talk about snapshots and append-only files for durability, which is important for data integrity but not related to the number of databases Redis supports.

So, putting it all together, the main section that clearly states Redis provides 16 databases by default is ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf."" All other mentions either refer to the same information or don't give a specific count. The other sections about ML and durability are supplementary but don't provide additional counts.

Therefore, the answer should be 16 databases as per the first section.

The Redis database supports 16 default databases based on the provided context.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis actually supports based on the given context. Let me start by reading through each paragraph carefully.

First, I see that in ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" there's a mention of 16 databases by default. That seems straightforward: Redis provides 16 databases. The text says they are numbered from 0 to 15 and there's no other name associated for them.

Then, moving on to the ""Redis DB"" section, it talks about Redis being an open-source in-memory database system. It mentions that Redis supports various models like KV store, but also gives examples of other models such as Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, and Time Series. However, when I look back at the initial response, the assistant already answered with 16 databases, which is consistent.

In ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" there's a mention about Redis in DS/ML (Data Science / Machine Learning). The section discusses Redis supporting feature stores for machine learning tasks, like simplified examples. But again, the key point is that Redis supports 16 databases by default.

There are also other paragraphs about specific features and capabilities of Redis, such as data types, query support, indexing, replication, load balancing, document storage, etc. These don't add any new information about the number of databases Redis supports; they just elaborate on Redis's functionalities.

I'm making sure I didn't miss anything in each paragraph that could hint at more or fewer than 16 databases. The key line in ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" clearly states that it provides 16 databases by default, without mentioning any alternatives or variations. Similarly, the other sections don't contradict this number.

So putting it all together, Redis supports 16 databases based on the information given.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis actually supports. From the context provided, I see several documents about Redis. Let me go through them one by one to find the answer.

First, looking at ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22, chunk Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default - They are numbered 0 to 15 - There is no other name associated - Direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs..."". Here it says Redis provides 16 databases by default. Each database is numbered from 0 to 15, and there's no alternative name mentioned for them.

Another document is ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17, chunk Redis DB - Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database - Sometimes called a data structure store - Primarily a KV store, but can be used with other models: Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, Time Series..."". It mentions that Redis is primarily a KV store, but it can handle other models. However, this doesn't change the number of databases Redis supports; it's still 16 by default.

There's also ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12, chunk Redis in Context 13) with similarity 196.95"". This document discusses Redis in the context of Python, but again, it doesn't mention how many databases Redis supports. It still remains at 16.

Looking further down, ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 14, chunk Redis in DS/ML..."" and others are similar; they focus on using Redis with Python but don't provide any information about the number of supported databases.

Finally, ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 13, chunk Redis in ML - Simplified Example..."", again, these documents discuss implementing Redis in Python but don't address the database count. The context ends without adding new information on Redis's database support.

So, after reviewing all these documents, I'm certain that Redis supports 16 databases by default.
