I don't know. The context provided does not appear to mention AVL trees or their characteristics, including the requirement for multiple rotations due to specific types of imbalances. The context seems to be related to data replication, monotonic read consistency, observations on arrays and linked lists, binary search tree, isolation in relational databases, and optimistic concurrency.|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The provided context appears to be a collection of documents on various topics such as data replication, foundations, and NoSQL databases. There is no information about AVL trees or their imbalances that would allow me to answer this specific question.|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The context provided appears to be about NoSQL databases, concurrency control, data replication, and other topics unrelated to AVL trees or tree balancing. There is no mention of AVL trees or their balancing techniques. If you have a different context or question related to AVL trees, I would be happy to try and assist you.|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
