Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Hmm, let's see. From the context provided, there are several files and chunks related to data structures and algorithms. The query is about imbalances that cause multiple rotations for an AVL tree.

First, I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node maintains its height difference with its children within one. That means it's always balanced, right? But maybe under certain conditions or when there are specific types of imbalances, the tree might become unbalanced and require more rotations to rebalance.

Looking at the context files:

- From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf, page 13: They mention trees with similarity 0.48. I don't see anything about rotations here, so maybe not related to that.
  
- From 02 - Foundations.pdf, pages 12 and 13: It talks about binary search trees using a BST concept, similar to an AVL tree, since it's a balanced structure with properties. But again, no mention of imbalances requiring multiple rotations.

- From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf, page 9: Weighted vs Unweighted with similarity 0.49. Doesn't seem related to imbalances or rotations.
  
- From 04 - Data Replication.pdf, page 0: Some material about data replication and references, but not relevant here.

So, the only file that seems directly related is from 02 - Foundations.pdf, where they mention a binary tree with properties. Since an AVL tree maintains balance by ensuring each subtree's height difference is at most one, if an imbalance occurs (like a node being too high or low), it triggers rotations to rebalance.

I think the key here is that imbalances that cause multiple levels of imbalance require multiple rotations because the tree isn't just unbalanced in one place but in several. For example, if one subtree is significantly taller than another, an imbalance could lead the root node to need several rotations down the line or up from a deeper level.

The kind of imbalances that require multiple rotations in an AVL tree occur when there are significant height differences between subtrees. Specifically, when one subtree becomes too deep while the other remains relatively balanced, the tree's balance is compromised. This leads to requiring multiple rotations to rebalance the structure by adjusting nodes along the path from the root or a specific level."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations to fix. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. That way, it maintains a balance and ensures that operations like insertion, deletion, and search are efficient.

Now, imbalances in trees can occur when they aren't properly balanced. For example, if the left subtree is significantly taller than the right subtree, or vice versa. In such cases, during an operation, the tree might require rotations to rebalance itself again. 

I think there's something called ""imbalance degree"" that measures how far off the balance is. If one side is even two levels taller than the other, it's considered heavily imbalanced. This imbalance can cause a situation where two rotations are needed because a single rotation won't fix both issues.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Sometimes people talk about balancing factors or degrees of imbalances, but maybe it's more specific to AVL trees. In an AVL tree, the balance is maintained by ensuring that each node's subtree heights don't differ by two or more. So any imbalance beyond one level can cause rotation operations.

I also recall that if a node has more than two children in some cases, balancing might require multiple rotations. But I think in standard binary trees like AVL trees, we only have two children per node. Maybe the key is something else, not just the immediate nodes but deeper imbalances.

Let me think of an example. Suppose the left subtree is three levels taller than the right. How would that affect the tree? If during a search or insertion operation, the tree becomes unbalanced in both directions, each rotation might fix part of it, but perhaps two rotations are needed to rebalance everything back.

Wait, I'm getting confused now. Maybe I should look up some resources on AVL trees and imbalances requiring multiple rotations. Oh well, since I don't have access right now, I'll try to recall what I remember. I think the key is when a node has a subtree imbalance of more than one level, like a three-level difference, it requires two rotations to rebalance.

So, putting it together, imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations are those where the tree's left and right subtrees aren't within one level of each other. And in such cases, rotating two times can bring them back into balance.

The imbalance that requires multiple rotations in an AVL tree is when the tree's left and right subtrees differ by more than one level. Specifically, imbalances where one subtree is at least three levels taller than the other necessitate two rotation operations to restore balance.

**Answer:** Imbalances requiring multiple rotations in an AVL tree are those where the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees exceeds one level, typically causing two rotations to rebalance."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that an AVL tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. The key property of an AVL tree is that the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This means that for every node, it must have a balance factor where the left subtree height minus the right subtree height equals -1, 0, or +1.

So, if there's an imbalance in an AVL tree, that would mean either the left subtree is deeper than the right, or vice versa, beyond just differing by one. This can cause issues because it violates the AVL property, which could lead to performance degradation when searching for data or inserting new elements into the tree.

Now, I need to recall what causes imbalances in an AVL tree. There are a couple of common cases where imbalances occur:

1. **Left-Height Difference Greater Than One**: If the left subtree is two levels deeper than the right. This imbalance would require rotations because we can't maintain the balance without restructuring the tree.

2. **Right-Height Difference Greater Than One**: Similarly, if the right subtree is two levels deeper than the left, it's an imbalance that needs adjustment through rotation.

3. **Different Heights by More Than One on Both Sides**: This would create a more severe imbalance where both subtrees are more than one level off in their heights, necessitating multiple rotations to rebalance.

So, putting this together, any AVL tree with an imbalance where the two child subtrees have a height difference of two or more levels requires multiple rotations. These rotations ensure that the tree remains balanced and maintains its AVL property.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Are there other scenarios? Well, perhaps some imbalances can be fixed without needing multiple rotations, but in most cases, especially when dealing with larger imbalances, you'll have to perform several rotation operations—like left or right rotations—to balance the tree back to its AVL property.

Therefore, yes, any imbalance where the heights of the subtrees differ by two or more levels will require multiple rotations to restore the AVL property.
</think>

The imbalances in an AVL tree that necessitate multiple rotations occur when the heights of the left and right child subtrees differ by two or more levels. These situations must be corrected through rotation operations, such as left or right rotations, which help maintain the balance required for the AVL tree's properties.
