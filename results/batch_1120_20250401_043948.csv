Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was actually released. Let me look through the context provided and see if there's any information about that.

First, scanning the text, I see references like ""Redis in DS/ML 15"" on page 0 of the PDF. That link probably refers to a source where Redis is discussed as part of some discussion or article. 

Wait, but none of those sections mention when Redis was released as an open-source project. They're talking about other topics like database integration with Python and ML frameworks. I don't see any information about when Redis itself was created. It's possible that Redis hasn't been officially released yet because it's still in the planning or development stages, especially since many other databases have already come out.

Looking at the other files mentioned, they all seem to be related to Redis using Python and MySQL, but again, there's no info on when Redis was released. I'm trying to remember if I've heard of Redis being developed by a specific company. Checking my memory, I think Redis is part of the Open Source Initiative, which started in 2014. But that doesn't mean it's been released yet; it's still in the early stages.

So, putting it all together, based on the context provided, there isn't enough information to confirm when Redis was actually released as an open-source project. The information given is about Redis being used in different contexts without mentioning its official release date.

The context provided does not contain any information about when Redis was released as an open-source project. It discusses Redis in various contexts but doesn't specify the actual release date.

Alright, I need to determine when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant section.

First, looking at ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12, chunk Redis in Context 13)"", it mentions that Redis is an open-source in-memory database system. It also notes that the Redis Company itself maintains Redis as a product, which suggests they might be around for some time.

Next, from ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22, chunk Redis Database and Interaction)"", I see that Redis is known to have been developed by the Redis Company since it's mentioned there. It also states that Redis supports durability with snapshots or an append-only file system.

Additionally, in ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 18, chunk Redis Data Types Keys)"", it mentions Redis was one of the initial databases developed by the Redis Company, reinforcing the idea that they've been around long enough to be considered released.

There are other documents like ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf"" with a line saying Redis is the standard client for Python and GitHub's redis/redis-py package. This indicates ongoing development and support.

Considering all these points— Redis being developed by the company, its durability features, and its active use as a Python client—it seems clear that Redis was released after 2009 when it began development.

Redis was released in 2009 when it started developing as an open-source in-memory database system. It has since been maintained and expanded by the Redis Company, known for its durability features and active use in various applications, including Python and other programming languages."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Redis was released. First, I remember that Redis is an in-memory database system, which means it's designed to handle large datasets without slowing down the server. From what I recall, it's often used in machine learning and AI because of its speed and memory efficiency.

Looking at the context provided, there are several files related to Redis and Python. The first one mentions ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 14, chunk Redis in DS/ML 15)"". That section probably talks about using Redis with Python for machine learning tasks. The numbers mentioned like 183.81, 185.52, etc., are likely similarity scores from some database or file comparison tool. These don't seem directly related to when Redis was released.

The next part under ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12, chunk Redis in Context 13)"" mentions that it's a KV store and ranks at 18 for the top KV stores by rank. Again, this doesn't provide any information on release date.

Then there are sections about NoSQL databases, discussing Redis as an in-memory database with specific commands like `redis://` or `python:Redis`. The details mention that Redis has 16 default databases and supports various operations. But again, these don't include when it was released.

In the section on ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", page 22 talks about Redis providing 16 default databases with durability options for storage snapshots or roll-forward if data fails. Page 18 discusses Redis's speed and supports various commands but doesn't mention release date.

The file at ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 13, chunk Redis in ML)"" mentions a simplified example of Redis in machine learning, with a similarity score of about 229. The last part under that file mentions Redis was released around early 2014 and is still active.

There's another section at ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 19, chunk Redis Data Types Keys)"" which lists common data types but doesn't include release info. The Docker section under page 21 also discusses Redis setup without mentioning when it was released.

So, putting this all together, the most relevant information about Redis's release date is in that third file where it's stated that Redis was released around early 2014 and continues to be active.
