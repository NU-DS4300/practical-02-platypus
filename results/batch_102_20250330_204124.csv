Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me look through the context provided.

First, I see that Redis is mentioned in a few places. On page 5 of the NoSQL Intro book, it's listed as an open source KV store. Then on pages 17 and 22, there are sections about Redis providing several databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15.

Looking further down, the section on ""Direct interaction with Redis"" mentions that Redis has 16 databases by default and explains how they're managed through specific commands. There's also a bullet point saying Redis provides 16 databases by default.

Then, in another part of the same book, it says that Redis was originally developed in 2009 in C++. I think this means that Redis has been around longer than 10 years because the development started back then, so I can't say when Redis was actually released yet. It just had a long history before being publicly available.

So putting it all together, Redis isn't a software release per se but a platform that's built on C++ and has been in use since at least 2009.

Redis is not a specific software release but rather an open-source KV store that originated from the Redis programming language developed by the company. It was first conceived around 2009 but came to public availability much later.

Answer: Redis was conceptualized and initially released as a programming language in 2009 before being made publicly available."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me go through each section one by one.

First, in the NoSQL DBs.pdf file at page 17, it mentions Redis is an open-source KV store and primarily a data structure store. It also says Redis is maintained by the company and provides a GitHub repository for Redis-py in Python. That doesn't mention when it was released yet.

Looking at the next section about Redis + Python.pdf on page 1, Redis is listed as the standard client for Python and was hosted in a 4300 Conda Environment. Again, no release date mentioned here.

Another section from the NoSQL DBs.pdf file talks about 16 default databases, mentions durability features like saving snapshots and an append-only file with a journal for roll-forward support. This is about Redis being efficient but doesn't specify when it was released.

The last part in NoSQL DBs.pdf discusses Redis's history, developed in C++ since 2009 and can handle large transactions efficiently with up to 100,000 set operations per second. It also mentions no secondary indexes and supports lookup by key only. This section provides the technical details but doesn't include a release date.

Since all the sections discuss Redis's features and capabilities without mentioning any explicit release dates, it seems like Redis was released after these topics were covered. However, since none of the provided information includes a specific release date, I can't definitively state when Redis was actually released.
</think>

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of Redis being released. It discusses Redis's features and capabilities, including its durability and transactional efficiency. Therefore, while Redis supports large transactions with up to 100,000 SET operations per second and uses a journal for roll-forward support, it was not explicitly released in the provided context.

Answer: Redis was not explicitly released based on the provided information."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me look through the context provided.

In the context, I see several documents discussing Redis. One is about NoSQL introduction with KV databases and another on Redis in Python. There's also a section about Redis being an in-memory database system that supports durability features and has 100,000 SET operations per second. 

Looking at the documentation for Redis.py, there's a list of commands provided as a full list, but it's not exhaustive. So, I don't have all the commands listed, just some highlights.

The first document mentions that Redis was developed in C++ originally and is now an open-source project. The second one talks about Python integration as the standard client. 

I recall that Redis was released in 2012. Before 2012, there were several projects focused on in-memory databases like Hadoop's MapReduce (HBase) and Apache Flink (Futle). But Redis became popular around then.

So, putting this together, Redis should have been released in early 2012.

Redis was released in early 2012."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo. You are also an expert in AWS as a service.
