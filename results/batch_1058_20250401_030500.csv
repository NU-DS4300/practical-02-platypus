Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. I've read through the context provided, and it seems like it's related to graph databases and their query languages. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the context, there are a few documents mentioned. The first one is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" on page 2, which talks about Cypher being Neo4j's graph query language created in 2011. That seems pretty concrete. It mentions that Cypher was introduced as a visualization tool for matching patterns and relationships in graphs.

Then, there's another document from page 1, ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" on page 1, which discusses the general nature of Neo4j as both a transactional and analytical processing system. It also mentions it supports various types of indexing, ACID compliance, distributed computing, and similarity to Microsoft CosmoDB or Amazon Neptune.

Next, there's an ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" on page 20 that explains how Neo4j works, including its graph model as a relatively new class of NoSQL databases. It also mentions supporting various types of indexing, ACID compliance, and distributed computing. This reinforces the idea that Neo4j was designed for both transactional and analytical processing.

Then, from another document on page 0, it references ""DS 4300 Neo4j Mark Fontenot's material"" about graph algorithms and examples with Apache Spark or Neo4j. It also mentions similarity scores to other systems like CosmoDB and Neptune. This suggests that Neo4j is being used effectively in various contexts beyond just its query language, which might indicate a long-standing presence.

Looking further down the document, it provides more details on how Neo4j's graph query language was introduced as Cypher, explaining that it allows for visualization of nodes and connections. It mentions the APOC Plugin and add-on libraries like Gravity Search and Map Reduce, both mentioned by Needham and Hodler. This shows that the functionality has been enhanced over time with various plugins, which is typical for software development.

Additionally, Neo4j supports similarity 0.16, indicating it's a well-received version of its graph query language. It also mentions it's similar to CosmoDB but introduced first, as noted by similarity scores.

Putting this all together, the context suggests that Neo4j was developed in 2011 when Cypher was introduced, and since then, it has evolved with various enhancements like plugins and add-ons to improve its capabilities. The other documents support the idea that Neo4j's query language is part of a mature system designed for both transactional and analytical processing.

So, considering all this information, I think the answer is that Neo4j's graph query language was introduced in 2011 when Cypher was created.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was introduced in 2011. This early version served as a visualization tool for querying and analyzing graph-based data. Over time, Neo4j evolved with the addition of various plugins and add-ons, such as APOC Plugin and Gravity Search, enhancing its capabilities beyond just transactional processing, making it suitable for both analytical tasks and machine learning applications. The introduction of Cypher in 2011 laid the foundation for Neo4j's graph query language, which has since become a powerful tool in graph databases."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language, also known as Cypher, was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j and its history.

From the context provided, I see that Neo4j was created in 2011. The document mentions that Cypher is part of this system and refers to an APAC plugin called Ancestral Procedures on Cypher (APAC). It also notes that Neo4j supports various graph processing features like transactional and analytical processing.

I think the key point here is the year when Neo4j was first released. Since the context says 2011, I believe that's the correct answer. The mention of Ancestral Procedures and its similarity score to a previous version also supports this timeline.

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented in 2011.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Looking at the context provided, it seems that Neo4j uses Cypher as its query language. In the document ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Cypher - Neo4jâ€™s graph query language created in 2011)"", it mentions that Cypher was created by a company in 2011.

Wait, actually, I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. The context does say that the Cypher was created in 2011, but I should verify this. From what I know, Neo4j's graph query language is indeed based on Cypher. And I think it started being used around 2011. Yeah, so that must be when it was invented.

Neo4j's graph query language, which is implemented in Cypher, was first introduced in 2011.
