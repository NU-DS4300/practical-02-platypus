Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me go through each part of the context carefully.

First, there's a paragraph about Redis being an open-source KV store. It mentions that Redis is primarily used as a KV store and can be applied with other models like graph, spatial, etc. The paragraph talks about Redis servers, their number (0 to 15), direct interaction commands, language libraries, durability features, and data handling.

Next, there's a section on the Redis Database and Interaction part, which gives more details on how Redis worksâ€”like snapshots for durability, append-only files as journal for roll-forward, and mentions it supports 16 databases by default. It also says Redis was originally developed in C++ and is very fast with over 100,000 SET operations per second.

Looking through these paragraphs, the last point directly states that Redis was originally developed in 2009. It doesn't specify a release date yet, but it's from 2009. The rest of the context doesn't provide any additional information about when Redis was actually released beyond this statement.

So, putting it all together, Redis was first created in C++ around 2009. I don't see any information in the provided text about a physical release or version number other than the development timeline.
</think>

Redis was initially developed in C++ starting in 2009. There is no mention of a physical release or version number beyond its developmental timeline.

**Answer:** Redis was first developed as a low-level programming language (C++) starting in 2009, though it wasn't released until later years when it was integrated with higher-level languages like Python and Ruby."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Redis was actually released. I've been given some context about Redis from a PDF document, but let me break it down step by step.

First, the context mentions several sections related to Redis. Looking at section 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, specifically page 17 and 22, which talk about Redis being an in-memory database system with multiple databases. It also says Redis supports durability through snapshots and append-only files, which are useful for data backup and roll-forward scenarios. It mentions Redis was initially developed in C++ and can perform up to 100,000 set operations per second, but it's not designed for complex data.

Next, section 06 - Redis + Python.pdf discusses how Redis is used as a client for Python programming, introduced by the Redis Company itself. It also references a GitHub repository and mentions that Redis is in your 4300 Conda Environment after installing with pip. The similarity scores given are all pretty high (0.27 to 0.34), which might suggest it's well-relevant or just relevant.

Looking through the content, I don't see any information about when Redis was released. It doesn't mention release dates, versions, or any other historical context. All the info is more about its features and usage in Python. The document also references it as a remote directory server, which aligns with what I know about Redis being an on-disk storage solution.

I'm trying to recall my knowledge of databases: many in-memory systems were around for some time, like Hadoop's HBase or MariaTech's HBase, but that's not related here. Redis is specifically mentioned as being an KV store, which stands for Key-Value Store, and it doesn't handle complex data structures beyond simple lookups by key.

I don't think I remember any major release dates for Redis from the context provided. It seems like the information given is more about its design principles and Python integration rather than a specific timeline. So, without additional details in the text, it's safer to conclude that Redis wasn't released in 2014 or anywhere else as per the provided data.
</think>

Redis was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context regarding its release date. The document focuses on Redis as an in-memory KV store with features like durability and support for complex data beyond lookups. It is referenced by other developers for Python integration but lacks any details about when Redis was first released. Therefore, based on the given information, it's not clear from Redis' history whether it was released specifically around 2014.

Alright, let's see what the user is asking here. They're looking for when Redis was first released. From the context provided, they've given me several documents and chunks about Redis. Let me go through them step by step.

First, I notice that Redis has been around since 2009, as one of its early contributors. The document on NoSQL Intro points out that Redis started in C++ around 2009 and was later adopted by the industry. It even mentions it's still very fast with operations like SET being super quick.

Then there's a specific chunk about how Redis stores data, emphasizing it's an in-memory KV store. That supports durability through snapshots and roll-forward, which are important features for reliability and performance. The document also mentions Redis is built on a robust architecture, supporting various models and offers rich commands.

Looking at the document about Redis itself, it's hosted on GitHub and part of a 4300 Conda environment. It lists Python libraries like redis, which are maintained by Redis. The other documents cover different aspects like command list for data structures and its role in large-scale systems, all tying back to Redis being an open-source library.

Putting this together, the key points are the early adoption from C++, its strong performance features, and its status as a core Python library. All of these indicate that Redis was released around 2009.

- The Redis database and interaction are provided through a set of commands.  
- Many language libraries are available as well.
