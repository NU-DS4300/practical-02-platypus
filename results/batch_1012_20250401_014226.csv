"Based on the provided context, I found that Redis is a popular in-memory data store, and according to the source (https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/), it was not explicitly mentioned when Redis was released.

However, I can tell you that Redis was open-sourced in 2004 by Salvatore Sanfilippo. It's possible that a beta or alpha version might have existed before its official release, but the exact date is not provided in this context.

So, to answer your question, I don't know the exact release date of Redis based on this context."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
