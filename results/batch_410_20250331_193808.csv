Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations to fix. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two subtrees of every node differ by at most one. This helps keep operations like insertion and deletion efficient because they take O(log n) time instead of O(n), which would be way too slow for large datasets.

Now, when a BST becomes unbalanced, that's when things get tricky. If an AVL tree is perfectly balanced, it's fine, but any imbalance means we might need to fix it by rotating nodes. I think the key here is the balance factor of a node. The balance factor is the height difference between the left and right subtree. For an AVL tree, this can't be more than 1.

So, if the balance factor becomes greater than 1 or less than -1, that's when we have imbalances. But how do you fix these? I remember something about rotations. There are two types: right rotation and left rotation. Right rotation involves moving a node from the left subtree to the root, and left rotation is the opposite.

I think if a node in the tree has a left child with a larger balance factor than it, meaning the left side is too heavy, you might need a right rotation. Similarly, if there's an imbalance on the right side, moving nodes upwards would require a left rotation. These rotations help bring the tree back into balance.

Let me think about different types of imbalances:

1. **Left Rotation**: This happens when the root has a right child that is deeper than the left subtree. So, to fix this, we move the right child up and move its right child down as far left as possible. After moving, the new root's balance factor should be checked.

2. **Right Rotation**: This occurs when the root has a left child that's deeper than the right subtree. We perform a right rotation by moving the left child up and adjusting accordingly.

3. **Double Left Rotate**: I think this is where you first do a left rotation on the root, which might cause another imbalance in its new position to the left. So, we have to rotate again from there.

4. **Double Right Rotate**: Similarly, if after rotating right, the new left child causes an imbalance, you rotate again.

I'm not entirely sure about all these names, but I think each situation requires a series of rotations. The number of rotations depends on how unbalanced the tree is in different directions.

So, to answer the question: imbalances that require multiple rotations are those where the tree is highly skewed either on the left or right side. For example, if the root's right child is much deeper than the left subtree (left-heavy imbalance), a single right rotation would fix it. But if both sides are too unbalanced in their respective directions, you might need two rotations.

Wait, actually, I'm getting confused between the number of rotations needed and when each type of imbalance requires which rotations. Maybe an example will help.

Let's say we have a tree where the left subtree is much taller than the right. This would cause the balance factor to be negative at the root. To fix this, you'd perform a right rotation on the root, moving its right child up and down as far left as possible. After that, the new root's balance should improve.

On the other hand, if both left and right subtrees are too deep, perhaps there are two imbalances: one in the left and another in the right. Each might require a rotation individually, so you'd need two rotations to fix.

I think I've got it now. The key is that an AVL tree requires multiple rotations when the imbalance affects either the left or right side in different ways, necessitating separate rotations for each.

In an AVL tree, imbalances that require multiple rotations occur when the tree is heavily skewed on either the left or right side. Specifically:

- **Left Rotation (Double Left Rotate)**: When the root's right child is much deeper than the left subtree. A single right rotation fixes this imbalance.

- **Right Rotation (Double Right Rotate)**: When the root's left child is deeply embedded, a single left rotation corrects it.

- **Combination of Imbalances**: If both side imbalances require separate rotations, two rotations are needed in total.

Thus, to fix an AVL tree's imbalance, multiple rotations may be necessary depending on how different sides are skewed."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. First, I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, and operations like search, insert, and delete have logarithmic time complexity.

Imbalance in the context of AVL trees can occur when the subtree heights don't follow this rule. There are two main types: left imbalance and right imbalance. Left imbalance happens when a node's right subtree is taller than its left subtree by more than one level, while right imbalance is the oppositeâ€”when a node's left subtree is taller.

Now, I need to focus on imbalances that require multiple rotations for correction. I recall that in an AVL tree, if there's a single node where the balance condition isn't met (either height difference of two or more), a single rotation can fix it. But sometimes, you might have a situation where both left and right subtrees are unbalanced beyond just one level. For example, imagine a root with two children: one child has its subtree imbalance resolved by one rotation, but the other's balance is still off.

In such cases, a second rotation is needed to correct both imbalances. I think this leads to what's called an ""imbalance of 2"". So, when the height difference between two subtrees is exactly two, you might need to perform two rotations: one to fix the left imbalance and another for the right one.

I also remember that in some cases, if there are multiple imbalances (e.g., four levels deep), it might require more than two rotations. But generally, for a simple imbalance where only one node's subtrees are unbalanced, you need just one rotation.

To visualize this, let's consider an AVL tree where the root has two children. One child is balanced but the other isn't. The unbalanced part could be deeper in each subtree. Rotating to balance both would require adjusting both sides, hence needing multiple rotations.

So, putting it all together, imbalances that require multiple rotations in an AVL tree are those where two subtrees have a height difference of exactly two levels beyond the single level imbalance.

Imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when there's a node whose left and right subtree heights differ by exactly two levels. This situation necessitates performing two rotations to balance both subtrees, resulting in what is known as an ""imbalance of 2."" 

**Answer:** Imbalance of 2."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees.

An AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which helps maintain efficient operations like insertion and deletion. If the tree becomes unbalanced, it's not an AVL tree anymore, and this can lead to degraded performance because the height increases, making lookups slower.

The question is about imbalances that require multiple rotations. I remember that in a binary search tree, when inserting a new node causes the tree to become unbalanced on one side, we need rotations to rebalance it. But how many rotations are needed?

Let me think of a specific example. Suppose we have an AVL tree and insert a node in such a way that the right subtree becomes taller than the left by more than one level. In this case, only one rotation is sufficient to restore balance. This type of imbalance usually happens when inserting into a leaf node.

But what about other imbalances? If there's an imbalance on both sides, maybe two rotations are needed. For example, if inserting a node causes both the right and left subtrees to become unbalanced beyond their allowed heights. In this case, we might need to perform two rotations to rebalance the tree.

Wait, I think I've heard that in certain cases, more than one rotation is necessary when multiple imbalances occur. So, it's not just a simple single-node insertion causing an imbalance but also situations where multiple levels of the tree are affected.

I should verify this with some diagrams or examples. When inserting into a leaf node, only one rotation is needed. If both left and right subtrees have too many nodes, maybe two rotations. But what if three imbalances occur? Maybe more rotations?

Also, I recall that an AVL tree can handle up to a certain number of imbalances with specific rotation counts. For instance, when inserting into the right subtree, it requires one rotation on the left child. If inserting in the middle somewhere else, multiple rotations are needed.

I think I should structure this by considering different scenarios: single node insertion, two levels of imbalance, etc., and then determine how many rotations are required for each.
</think>

In an AVL tree, imbalances that require multiple rotations occur when there's a significant height difference on one or both sides. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Single Node Insertion in a Leaf Node**: Only 1 rotation is needed to balance the tree.

2. **Imbalance on Both Sides**: When both left and right subtrees are affected, typically requiring 2 rotations.

3. **Multiple Imbalances**: In more complex scenarios with multiple levels of imbalance beyond two, multiple rotations might be necessary. However, this depends on the specific structure and how imbalances propagate during insertions or deletions.

Thus, the number of rotations needed in an AVL tree for imbalances varies based on the level and severity of the imbalance."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
