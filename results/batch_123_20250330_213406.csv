Okay, so I need to figure out what the EC2 lifecycle is based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the query and the given context carefully.

The query asks for an explanation of the EC2 lifecycle. The context gives several points about EC2's lifecycle using different chunks from a document. Each chunk seems to describe specific aspects or phases during which an EC2 instance operates.

Looking at the chunks provided:
1. One mentions ""launching"" with different configurations, starts and stops, terminalization, rebooting.
2. Another talks about using EC2 for web hosting, data processing, machine learning, and disaster recovery.
3. There's a mention of common use cases within each section.
4. Some chunks like ""Let’s Spin Up an EC2 Instance 10"" indicate steps someone might take when setting up EC2 instances.

I should focus on what defines the lifecycle in general. From the context, it seems to cover all the phases that EC2 can go through once an instance is created. These phases include starting with a chosen configuration, managing usage (suspend, terminate), deleting or rebooting the instance. It also covers various use cases like hosting websites, processing data, machine learning, and disaster recovery.

So putting it together, the EC2 lifecycle involves creating the instance, managing its operations through start/stop, termination, and rebooting, as well as managing its storage resources for different applications and services.

Okay, I need to figure out what the EC2 lifecycle is based on the given context. Let me go through each relevant part step by step.

First, looking at ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf (page 4)"", it mentions launching an instance and starting/terminating it. That's one part of the cycle. Then in ""From 12 - ... page 5"", they talk about rebooting without losing data on the root volume, which seems like another step.

In ""From 12 - ... page 9"", there's a chunk discussing Let’s Spin Up an EC2 Instance at 0.33 similarity. That suggests that once you start an instance, it goes through some steps until it's ready to be used.

The other document, ""From 04 - Data Replication.pdf (page 5)"", mentions AWS pricing but I'm not sure how this ties into the EC2 lifecycle directly. It seems like it's about costs but isn't part of the process itself.

So, putting it all together, the EC2 lifecycle involves starting an instance, perhaps stopping it temporarily, and then eventually booting up a new instance without data loss. That makes sense because you need to make sure data is available when the new instance starts.
</think>

The EC2 lifecycle refers to the steps an EC2 instance goes through, which include:

1. **Launching**: Starting with a chosen configuration.
2. **Temporary Suspend**: Temporarily stopping usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Termination**: Permanently deleting the instance.

These steps ensure data integrity when transitioning from one instance to another."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the EC2 lifecycle is based on the context provided. Let me start by going through each of the provided documents and see if any mention something about the EC2 lifecycle.

First, there's a document titled ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" which has several chunks. The third chunk talks about EC2 Launch, where you can start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration, start/stop without deleting it, terminate it, and reboot it. It mentions things like temporary suspension and permanent deletion or rebooting.

Then there's ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" on page 6 about EC2 Use Cases, which includes web hosting, data processing, machine learning, and disaster recovery. That seems like the standard use cases for EC2.

Page 9 has a section labeled ""Let’s Spin Up an EC2 Instance,"" where it mentions similarities with other instances at 274.14, 290.67, etc. This suggests that EC2 instances can be scaled up and down based on needs.

Looking at the features listed in ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" page 3: Elasticity allows scaling up or down easily, using one of the standard AMIs or providing a custom AMI if needed. It also integrates with other services like S3, RDS, etc., and is pay-as-you-go for pricing.

Then there's ""From 04 - Data Replication.pdf"" which has an AWS EC2 Pricing section, but I don't see anything related to the EC2 lifecycle here.

Putting this all together: The context mentions EC2 instances being started, stopped, terminated, rebooted. It also talks about scaling up and down, use cases in web hosting, data processing, ML, disaster recovery. Features include elasticity for scaling and integration with other services. The pricing section might relate to costs but isn't directly about the lifecycle itself.

So, the EC2 lifecycle seems to be about how instances can be set up, managed, scaled, and shut down as needed for different computing needs.

The EC2 lifecycle refers to the management and setup of Amazon Web Services (AWS) instances. This includes starting, stopping, terminating, and rebooting instances based on computational requirements. The lifecycle involves scaling up or down instances dynamically using features like Elasticity. Instances can also be integrated with other services such as S3 and RDS for data handling. Additionally, disaster recovery is managed through EC2 instances. While the context doesn't provide direct pricing details but does mention cost aspects, it outlines how EC2 instances are used in various operational needs."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
