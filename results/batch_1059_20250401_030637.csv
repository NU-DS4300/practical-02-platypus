Okay, so I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for values based on the context provided. Let's start by looking through each of the given files and chunks.

From ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", it mentions that Redis has Data Types Keys like strings but can also be any binary sequence. So, I can note that strings are one type, with others being variants or extensions. But the main point here is to list the specific data types they support for values.

Looking at ""Redis in Context 13"", it shows examples of how Redis handles various data types: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. That gives me a good overview of the supported types, but I need to focus specifically on their names as defined by the user, not their functionality.

The next file is ""Redis + Python.pdf"", which provides example code for working with Redis in Python. It shows using the Redis client object, accessing values through methods like mset(), mget(), r.set(), and r.incr(). The output includes a list of values, but there's no explicit mention of data types here; it just demonstrates how to interact with Redis.

In ""Page 5"", the example code uses functions that return lists, strings, integers. However, without any data type names listed, it's hard to determine which specific types are being used in these examples beyond what's shown in the output.

The last file is a true converter from JSON to strings, but again, it doesn't provide any information on Redis data types here.

So, putting this together, I realize that while Redis supports several data types through its structure (like arrays for lists), the user specifically asked about the names of these data types. Since the initial context mentioned strings as a base type with others being variants, I can confidently list those as the supported data types.

I also need to ensure I'm not missing any other key points from the files that mention specific data types beyond what's already outlined in ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"". The Python examples don't seem to introduce new data types for the user; they're more about how to interact with an existing Redis instance.

Therefore, my final answer should list the data types supported by Redis as per the given context and mention any others that aren't covered in that specific section.

The data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. **Strings**: The fundamental type.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Implemented using lists in Redis, which can contain unsorted strings or other data.
3. **Sets (Unsorted Strings)**: Data structures that store unique elements without order.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain order of insertion.
5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Key-value pairs where keys are typically strings.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Data with location information, such as geospatial coordinates.

These data types form the basis of Redis's structure, supporting various operations through its command set and client implementation."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which data types Redis supports for storing values. From what I remember, Redis is a kind of in-memory database used often for things like caching or working with large datasets without needing to load everything into memory. They mentioned that Redis has several types of databases, mainly KV stores, but can also do other stuff.

Looking at the context provided, there are some sections about data types. In one part, it says they mention strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data with similarity 0.17. That's interesting. I think that's standard for most databases. So Redis probably supports those.

Then in another section, it talks about commands related to setting and getting values from the Redis client. They use functions like mset and get, which make sense because they're part of Redis' command language. This would be similar to other languages or frameworks that support these operations, so I guess this is standard across multiple implementations.

There's also mention of the Redis Database Object in Python using redis. The context includes some commands like set, incr for counting, and mget, which suggests that Redis can handle various data types beyond just strings. They also talk about geospatial data with a similarity score, which makes me think about how they might support different coordinate formats.

Wait, the user is asking specifically to name the data types supported by Redis. So maybe I should list all of them. Let's see: strings are standard, and then there are more complex structures like lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes. Oh, and geospatial data with similarity 0.17 might refer to specific spatial data formats.

Also, from the context about it being a NoSQL database, they mention geospatial data as part of values. So probably supports various types of numeric data for locations, like latitude and longitude.

Putting this together, Redis is known for supporting strings, lists (which can be arrays), sets (unique elements in an unsorted manner), sorted sets (ordered), hashes (mapping from one type to another), and geospatial data with similarity 0.17. So those should be the main data types it supports.

I think that covers most of what's mentioned, but I should double-check if there are any other specific data types or terms used in common discussions about Redis that might not be covered here. Maybe things like binary sequences for values, but I'm pretty sure strings and the others are standard.
</think>

Redis supports several data types for storing values. These include:

1. **Strings**: The primary type, supporting all character encoding rules.
2. **Lists**: As linked lists of elements.
3. **Sets**: Unique elements stored in an unsorted manner.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Ordered sets with unique elements.
5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Mapping from one type to another, with a focus on geospatial data.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Specifically supporting formats for latitude and longitude.

These types are fundamental across Redis, making it suitable for both traditional relational databases and NoSQL applications."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for values. From the context provided, there are several documents talking about Redis and how it handles different types of data. Let me go through each document step by step.

First, in ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", they mention that Redis Data Types have Keys and Values. So, I know that the keys are strings or binary sequences, which includes any kind of sequence since Redis uses binary to store it. The values, on the other hand, can be various things like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which map from a string to another string), and geospatial data with similarity.

Then, in ""Redis Data Types Keys:..."" document, they list the possible values for Redis Data Types as:
- Strings
- Lists
- Sets
- Sorted Sets
- Hashes (strings to strings)
- Geospatial data 20) with similarity 106.03

These seem pretty straightforward and cover all types except maybe for something I'm not seeing. They also mention that values can be binary sequences, but that's essentially what the keys are.

Looking at the Redis in DS/ML document, it talks about how Redis stores data in k/v pairs with different databases, numbered 0 to 15, and allows direct interaction through commands like set, mset, etc. It doesn't mention any specific value types beyond what's already covered by the keys.

The section on ""Redis in ML"" also reinforces that values are tied to keys as per the keys:values model. It mentions that Redis has various language libraries, but they all are based on this key-value model.

In the Python examples provided, like mset with a dictionary of keys mapping to values, and mget retrieving the values, it's clear that values can be any type that's stored in a key. The commands used here include mset (multisets), mget (get all values for multiple keys), hset (hashes), etc.

There are also examples where they use hash commands like hset and hget to manipulate data structures, which again show that values can be hashes or other types.

The section on Hash Commands mentions specific operations like hset and hget, which operate directly on the value space. This further supports that values in Redis can be various sequences of bytes, including strings, numbers, dates, UUIDs, etc., as long as they fit into this model.

I don't see any documents or explanations here that mention other types of data beyond what's already covered by keys and their corresponding values. All the information seems to point towards Redis primarily supporting string-based key-value pairs with various built-in types and some custom libraries for handling more complex data structures.

So, putting it all together, Redis supports a wide range of data types as values based on keys. The main categories are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. Each of these can be binary sequences or other types like integers or dates, depending on the context and use case.
</think>

Redis supports a variety of data types as values, each tied to specific key formats and structures:

1. **Strings**: Any sequence of bytes, including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (strings → string), and geospatial data.

2. **List**: A collection of items, which can be any type but is often a sequence for simplicity in many applications.

3. **Set**: An unordered collection of unique elements, suitable for scenarios where order doesn't matter and duplicates are allowed or disallowed.

4. **Sorted Set**: Similar to a set but ensures the elements are ordered, useful for maintaining data in a particular sequence.

5. **Hash**: A mapping from keys (strings) to values (any type), supporting forward-only operations with roll-forward capability upon failure.

6. **Geospatial Data**: Represents locations using coordinates or other geospatial parameters, handled as sequences of bytes.

These types are supported through commands like mset for storing multiple elements and hget for retrieving them, ensuring flexibility in handling various data structures within Redis."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
