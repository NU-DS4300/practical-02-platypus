"A question about balanced binary trees!

According to the context, it seems that we are referring to AVL Trees (named after Adelson-Velskii and Landis), a self-balancing binary search tree data structure.

In an AVL Tree, imbalances occur when the height of one subtree differs from the height of the other by more than 1. To maintain balance, rotations are performed to restore the tree's balance property. There are two types of rotations:

1. **Left Rotation**: When a node's left child is taller than its right child.
2. **Right Rotation**: When a node's right child is taller than its left child.

Now, regarding your question: What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?

The answer is: **Two consecutive rotations** are required when the imbalance is greater than 1 (i.e., the difference between the heights of the two subtrees is more than 1). This is known as a ""double rotation"" or ""multiple rotation"".

In such cases, the first rotation is performed to reduce the imbalance, and then another rotation is needed to maintain balance. These double rotations are used to restore the AVL Tree's balance property when the tree becomes unbalanced.

"What a delightful query!

To answer this question, I'll have to dig deep into my knowledge of graph data models and trees.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most one. This balancing is achieved through rotations, which are operations that maintain the tree's balance property.

Now, let's get to the question: What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?

According to my knowledge, an AVL tree can become imbalanced when a new node is inserted or deleted, causing the tree's height to deviate from the balanced state. In such cases, one or more rotations are performed to restore the balance.

Here are the types of imbalances that may require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-heavy subtree**: When a node is inserted on the left side of an existing node, the left subtree can become too tall, causing the tree's height to increase. In this case, a series of right rotations might be needed to rebalance the tree.
2. **Right-heavy subtree**: Conversely, when a node is inserted on the right side of an existing node, the right subtree can become too tall. A sequence of left rotations might be required to restore balance.
3. **Extreme height difference**: When the height difference between the left and right subtrees becomes extremely large (e.g., > 2), multiple rotations may be necessary to bring the tree back into balance.

In summary, an AVL tree can require multiple rotations when:

* A node is inserted on one side of the tree, causing a significant imbalance.
* The height difference between the left and right subtrees becomes extreme.

"I must say that the context provided seems unrelated to the query about AVL trees. The context appears to be related to graph data models, NoSQL databases, and relational databases.

However, I will attempt to answer the question to the best of my ability, as it is a fundamental concept in computer science.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the height of the tree remains relatively small by rotating nodes when the balance factor becomes unbalanced. The balance factor is calculated for each node as the difference between the height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree.

A single rotation in an AVL tree can correct imbalances caused by inserting or deleting a node. However, there are some scenarios where multiple rotations are required to restore the balance of the tree:

1. **Left-Right Imbalance**: When a node is inserted or deleted on the left side of the root, and then another insertion or deletion occurs on the right side of the same subtree, causing a left-right imbalance. In this case, two rotations (one left and one right) are required to balance the tree.
2. **Right-Left Imbalance**: When a node is inserted or deleted on the right side of the root, and then another insertion or deletion occurs on the left side of the same subtree, causing a right-left imbalance. Similarly, two rotations (one right and one left) are required to restore balance.

In these cases, multiple rotations are necessary to ensure that the tree remains balanced and efficient for search operations.
