Okay, so I need to figure out what Redis supports as its value data types based on the provided context. Let me go through each part carefully.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro"" section under Redis's page 19 and 20, it mentions that Redis supports several types of values: Strings, Lists (which are linked lists), Sets (which are unique unsorted strings), Sorted Sets, Hashes (which are string to string mappings), and Geospatial data with similarity. So that gives me a list.

Then, looking at the ""Redis + Python.pdf"" section on page 3, it's talking about Redis's command list. It mentions durability of data being saved snapshots or an append-only file for roll-forward. It also states that Redis supports lookup by key and doesn't handle complex data like graphs or time series. But I don't see any value types mentioned here beyond the ones from the first section.

Additionally, in the ""NoSQL Intro"" page 18, it says Redis is an in-memory database but can be very fast with 100,000 set operations per second. It supports durability through snapshots or a journal for roll-forward, which means the same data can be accessed after failure.

So putting this together, the main value types Redis supports are Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, and Geospatial data with similarity. The other sections don't add any new information on values but discuss other features like durability and usage in Python.

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- Strings
- Lists (which are linked lists)
- Sets (which are unique unsorted strings)
- Sorted Sets
- Hashes (string → string mappings)
- Geospatial data with similarity.

These types ensure efficient lookups and support durability mechanisms through snapshots or append-only files."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing and retrieving values. Let me start by looking through the context provided.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro"" chapter of page 19, there's a section about Redis Data Types Keys. It mentions that they are usually strings but can be any binary sequence. So, I know that strings are one of them, but it doesn't limit it to just strings; anything binary should work.

Then, in the same file on page 20, under ""Redis Database and Interaction,"" there's a list of keys: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are string → string), and geospatial data with similarity. So that gives me more types beyond just strings—lists, sets, etc.

Looking at the other parts of the context, like the ""NoSQL Intro"" file on page 18, it says Redis is an in-memory database system that supports durability by saving snapshots to disk or using a journal for roll-forward if there's a failure. It doesn't handle complex data but does support lookups by key.

The ""Redis + Python"" PDFs have sections on the Redis client and its commands. They mention commands like set, get, incr, and also string commands. The examples given in page 14 involve setting a value with keys and performing operations like incrementing and retrieving values.

Putting it all together, Redis seems to support various data types for storing and getting values: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (as functions or mappings), and geospatial data. It doesn't handle complex objects beyond simple key-value pairs. The context also mentions that while Redis isn't designed for complex data like objects, it's still used in ML with some simplifications.

Redis supports several data types for storing and retrieving values, including:

1. **Strings**: Any binary sequence can be stored as a string.
2. **Lists**: Can store multiple items.
3. **Sets**: Unique items without duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but sorted by order of insertion.
5. **Hashes**: Maps keys (strings) to values, often using functions or mappings.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Includes geospatial information with associated similarity scores.

Additionally, Redis doesn't handle complex objects beyond simple key-value pairs and is primarily used for in-memory storage, making it suitable for tasks like lookups by key but not designed for handling intricate data structures."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for values based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.

First, in page 19 of the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", it mentions that Redis supports several data types: strings, lists (or linked lists), sets (which are unique and unsorted), sorted sets, hashes (which are string-to-string mappings), and geospatial data. The similarity scores indicate that these are very important points to consider.

Looking at the other sections about Redis, especially the connection to Python, it gives examples of commands like mset, mget, set, get, incr, etc., which show how these data types are used in practice. Each example demonstrates functions related to various data types. For instance, mget is used for getting values from a key, while set and get are used for setting and retrieving values associated with specific keys.

I notice that Redis does not support complex data structures like graphs or vectors directly, which might be why it's referred to as a KV store but can handle other models when needed. The context also mentions different types of storage systems, which reinforces Redis' role as an in-memory database without the complexities often seen in other technologies.

In the Python section (page 3), the example code shows mset for creating key-value pairs and various get commands to retrieve values by keys or all associated values. This further illustrates how data is handled in Redis, particularly through its command list which includes methods for different data types.

Putting this together, the main data types Redis supports for values are strings, lists (or linked lists), sets (unique, unsorted), sorted sets, and hashes. The context also points out that while these are key-value pairs, they don't support more complex structures unless specific commands are used, which aligns with the examples provided.

I should make sure to cover all the data types mentioned: strings, lists, sets, hashes, and geospatial data. It's important to mention how each of these is utilized in Redis, especially for their practical applications in different scenarios.

The primary data types supported by Redis for values include:

1. **Strings**: Used for simple text storage.
2. **Lists (or Linked Lists)**: Support unsorted, mutable collections of items.
3. **Sets**: Unique and unsorted sets of strings, supporting fast lookups.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Sorted collection of unique strings, useful when order matters.
5. **Hashes (Key-Value Pairs)**: Strings to string mappings, providing efficient key lookup.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Supports spatial data with similarity scores.

Redis handles these types efficiently, leveraging commands like mset, mget, set, get, and incr for various operations."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
