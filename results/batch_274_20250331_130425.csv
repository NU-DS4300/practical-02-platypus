Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j introduced its graph query language. From the context provided, there are several documents discussing Neo4j and its query language. Let me go through them step by step.

First document is ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011."" So that's direct from the context. It mentions that Cypher was created in 2011, which suggests that Neo4j developed its query language around that time.

Another document talks about Neo4j as a graph database system with ACID compliance and distributed computing support, but it doesn't mention the introduction of Cypher or Neo4j's version. However, since it's from the same context, I think the first document is more relevant because it clearly states when Neo4j created its query language.

The third document mentions ""APOC Plugin"" with similarity 0.45 and ""Graph Data Science Plugin"" with a score of 0.28, but this doesn't touch on Cypher or Neo4j's versioning. Similarly, the fourth document from page 10 talks about Neo4j being used in Docker Compose with Docker Compose 4, which again doesn't mention the introduction of Neo4j's query language.

The fifth document is an introduction to the graph model, not directly related to Neo4j's Cypher or version. So consolidating all that, the most relevant information is from the first and second documents. The first one clearly states that Cypher was created in 2011, which is when Neo4j introduced its graph query language.

I should make sure there are no conflicting sources here. Since both documents are from the context provided and align with each other, I can confidently say that Neo4j's graph query language was introduced in 2011.

Neo4j introduced its graph query language, Cypher, in **2011**.

**Answer:** Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was created in 2011."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. I remember that Neo4j is a graph database and has some features related to querying data. There are these papers mentioned like ""Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011."" Hmm, does that mean Cypher was developed in 2011? 

Wait, but the user asked specifically about the invention of the graph query language, not just when it was first introduced. So maybe I should look into when Cypher was actually written or formalized. Since one of the papers mentions ""Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011,"" that seems like a key point.

I also recall seeing some research from Needham and Hodler about using Cypher with Apache Spark and Neo4j. They probably worked on extending the capabilities around 2019 or so, but maybe the core idea was established earlier. So combining these thoughts, it sounds like the graph query language in Neo4j originated somewhere before 2017, but the paper says it was created in 2011. That makes sense because Neo4j uses Cypher which is a declarative query language for graphs.

I should also consider if there's any other information from the context that might shed more light. The Docker compose YAML file has ports set to 7474 and 7687, but I don't see that relate to when Neo4j was invented. The other papers talk about how Neo4j works with graph databases, data models, and ACID compliance, which are more about its architecture than the query language's invention.

So putting it all together, the graph query language in Neo4j was probably formalized or developed around 2011 when the Cypher framework was created. The specific origin might have been a bit earlier, but the major event from the paper is that it was introduced in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was formally introduced in **2011** when it was created by an unspecified author (though mentioned alongside works on related technologies)."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j created its graph query language. From the context provided, there are several documents discussing Neo4j. Let me go through them one by one.

First, looking at ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2)"", it mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011 and provides a visual way to match patterns and relationships between nodes. That's a key point.

Then, on page 20 of the same document, there's a section titled ""A Graph Database System"" where they talk about its capabilities like transactional and analytical processing. It also mentions ACID compliance and distributed computing support, but I don't see any mention of query languages or graph databases in this part specifically.

Next, ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 3)"" seems to be a Docker Compose snippet where they set up the services including Neo4J with various plugins. This doesn't directly answer the question about when the query language was invented.

On page 0 of another document, it's talking about graph algorithms and practical examples using Apache Spark and Neo4j. Again, this is more about how to use Neo4j rather than its history regarding query languages.

Finally, ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 9)"" explains that relationships are directed with a [since] clause when creating edges. There's no mention of any query language here either; it's focused on the structure of the graph data.

So, putting this all together: The main points from page 2 and onwards clearly state that Neo4j was developed in 2011 to provide a visual way to handle relationships. Other documents either expand on how Neo4j works or show its integration with other tools but don't directly address the origin of the graph query language.
