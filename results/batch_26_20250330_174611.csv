Alright, I need to figure out how many rotations are required for the AVL tree to rebalance after a node is removed.

First, I'll recall what an AVL tree is. It's a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This ensures that the in-order traversal yields a sorted array and maintains efficient insertion and deletion operations with O(log n) time complexity.

Now, the query is about imbalances that require multiple rotations for rebalancing. I remember from my studies that when an element is removed from an AVL tree, there are two main scenarios: one where it's a parent node and another where it's a child.

For the parent node case (like in cases 05-05-10-b): If the parent node is missing, we need to check its children. If both are present but one has more than one child exceeding the balance, we might need two rotations. For example, if both left and right subtrees have a height difference greater than one, we'd perform a rotation on the parent's left child first, then another on the resulting tree.

For the child node case (like 05-10-3): If only the left child is missing or has an imbalance that affects the root, similar logic applies. We might need to rotate up twice from the original child upwards until the balance is maintained.

In both cases, multiple rotations are necessary because the tree's structure can't handle a single rotation to rebalance if it causes a deeper imbalance than allowed by the AVL properties.

I also think about the example provided in the context: 04 - Data Replication.pdf. The anomaly mentions Monotonic Read Consistency with anomalies when reading values out of order from multiple followers and ensuring that reads don't read older data after newer data. This isn't directly related to the AVL tree imbalances I'm thinking about, but it shows how maintaining balance is crucial.

So, putting it all together, the number of rotations required depends on whether the missing node is a parent or a child in an AVL tree and which subtrees are involved in causing imbalance.

The number of rotations required for an AVL tree to rebalance after a node's removal can be either one or two. This occurs depending on whether the missing node is a parent or a child and if their respective subtrees cause imbalances.

1. **Parent Node Missing (e.g., 05-05-10-b):**
   - If only one subtree of the parent has an imbalance, one rotation suffices.
   - If both subtrees are missing data but each causes a height difference greater than one, two rotations are needed to balance.

2. **Child Node Missing (e.g., 05-10-3):**
   - A single rotation is sufficient if only the child subtree is problematic.

Thus, in cases where multiple imbalances are present or require adjusting upwards from a parent node, two rotations are necessary for rebalancing."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let's see... I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. That means it maintains balance through rotations to keep this property.

First, when does an AVL tree start to get into trouble? Well, if inserting or deleting a node causes the heights of the two child subtrees to become unbalanced, that's an imbalance. But how bad is that enough to require multiple rotations?

I think about insertions first. Suppose I have a root with one left and right child. If I add another node, maybe in a way that makes the height increase unevenly on either side. For example, if I insert to the left of the root, making it two levels deep on the left but only one level on the right. That would make the tree unbalanced.

Wait, how many rotations does that take? If the tree is perfectly balanced before, and after insertion, it becomes a left-left imbalance where the left subtree is two higher than the right, then I think I might need one rotation. Maybe a single rotation to fix it.

But what about more severe imbalances? Like if the tree has an insertion that makes one side very deep compared to the other. For instance, if after inserting, the left subtree becomes three levels high while the right is only two. In that case, maybe I need two rotations to balance it out.

I should also consider deletion. Sometimes deleting a node can cause imbalance because of where it's removed, which might make one side deeper than the other. If that happens when there are multiple levels of imbalance, perhaps two rotations would be needed.

Wait, but in an AVL tree, each rotation is only used to fix the balance after a single insertion or deletion. So if you have a chain like inserting into the root where one child has more height, maybe it takes more than one rotation to balance.

I'm not sure about this exact scenario, so I might need to think about specific examples. For instance, inserting at the lowest level and having a left-heavy tree after that insertion would require rotating up from there. But how many rotations?

Alternatively, if I have two separate imbalances, maybe each requiring one rotation, totaling two.

I'm also trying to remember if I've heard before of cases where multiple rotations are necessary for balancing. Like when inserting in such a way that both sides get too deep. Maybe in certain tree structures or under specific conditions.

So, putting it all together: insertions that cause single-side imbalance might need one rotation, while insertions causing two-level imbalance would require two rotations.

In an AVL tree, multiple rotations are required when there's significant imbalance. Specifically:

1. **Single-Side Imbalance**: After inserting into a position that causes one side to be deeper than the other by one level (left-left or right-right imbalance), one rotation is needed.

2. **Two-Level Imbalance**: When an insertion results in both sides being deeper than balanced by two levels, two rotations are required.

Thus, multiple rotations are necessary for severe imbalances after insertions, typically one or two depending on the severity of the imbalance."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many rotations are required in an AVL tree when there's a specific imbalance that causes it. The user is asking about the number of rotations needed for certain kinds of imbalances.

First, let me recall what an AVL tree is. It's a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, and operations like insertion and deletion can be performed efficiently.

Now, the question is about imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations to fix. I think this relates to situations where a node doesn't have enough balance after an insertion or deletion, causing it to go out of sync with its parent nodes. In such cases, the system needs to perform rotations on either side to rebalance the tree.

I remember there are different types of imbalances that can occur. There's left-heavy and right-heavy imbalances where a node has more descendants in one direction than the other. Then there's the case where two child subtrees have different heights, leading to an imbalance based on their balance factors.

Let me consider specific examples to visualize this better. Suppose I insert a new element into the middle of a tree that already has some data. If this insertion causes one subtree to be too deep while the other isn't balanced enough, how would that affect the root node? Maybe if the left subtree is deeper than the right, or vice versa.

I also remember something about two kinds of imbalances: where a single level has more nodes on one side than another. This could lead to a balance issue in the root node's subtrees. Another scenario might involve a fork in the tree where there are multiple paths leading into a leaf, causing some imbalance.

Thinking about rotations, I believe that for each unit of imbalance, two rotations would be required. For instance, if one subtree is deeper by just one level than the other, it requires two rotations to balance. This makes sense because the tree has to ""rotate"" around the problematic node to ensure all subtrees stay balanced.

Wait, but could there be cases where more rotations are needed? I think in some complex scenarios or larger imbalances, maybe three rotations might be required, but that seems less common. Let me check my understanding with a simple example.

Suppose I have a perfectly balanced tree and I insert an element into the middle of the left subtree. This would cause the root node to now have a right-heavy subtree if the left wasn't deeper enough. To fix this, I might need to move an element up or down, which involves rotating around the root or another node.

But actually, moving elements directly is just swapping pointers. The key issue here is that one subtree becomes too deep while the other isn't balanced. So, for each level of imbalance beyond the immediate child, it takes two rotations. In this case, if the right subtree is deeper by one level, I might need to perform a rotation on either the root or one of its children, resulting in two overall rotations.

I think that's how it works. Each unit of imbalance (either left vs. right depth) requires two rotations to correct. So, if the imbalance is more than just a single level deep, like two levels out of balance, then it would take four rotations? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.

If I have an AVL tree with root node A, and its right child has three descendants while the left has only one. The root's balance factor is (3 - 1) = +2, which exceeds the allowed limit of +1 or -1 for a balanced tree. So, to fix this, the system would need to perform two rotations: one on either side. Rotating the right subtree up by one and then the left subtree down by one? Or something along those lines.

Yes, that makes sense because each rotation can balance out the imbalances caused at the root level. So, in such cases, it takes exactly two rotations to fix the tree.
</think>

In an AVL tree, when there's a specific imbalance, particularly where one subtree is deeper than the other by one unit (imbalance of ±1), two rotations are required to balance the tree.

**Answer:** Two rotations are needed for imbalances that cause a single level difference in heights."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
