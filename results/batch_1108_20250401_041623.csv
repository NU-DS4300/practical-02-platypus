"According to the provided context, I found relevant information about Redis on page 1 of the ""Redis + Python.pdf"" document (chunk Redis-py 2). It mentions that Redis-py is the standard client for Python and is maintained by the Redis Company itself. This suggests that Redis was released prior to the development of the Redis-py client, which implies that Redis has been around for a while.

However, I don't have an exact release date mentioned in this context. But if you'd like to know more about Redis' history or release timeline, I can try searching beyond this specific document or provide some general information on its development and evolution over time!"|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"Based on the provided context, I found a mention of Redis in the PDF chunk ""Redis in Context"" (page 12), which states that Redis is an ""Open source, in-memory database - Sometimes called a data structure store"". This implies that Redis has been open-sourced, but it doesn't specifically mention when it was released.

However, I found another PDF chunk ""Redis-py 2"" (page 1) mentioning the standard client for Python, Redis-py, which is maintained by the Redis Company itself. This implies that Redis has an official Python client library, suggesting that Redis itself has been around for some time.

After conducting a thorough search within the provided context, I couldn't find any direct information on when Redis was released. If you need more specific information, I suggest consulting external sources or searching online."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The context you provided does not mention a specific release date for Redis. It appears to be related to Redis in the context of data science and machine learning, as well as providing information on how to use Redis with Python.
