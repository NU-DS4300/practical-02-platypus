Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by recalling the context provided. The user mentioned a PDF about Redis and NoSQL databases, which talks about Redis having 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. They also mention that Redis is an in-memory database system and supports durability features like snapshots or append-only files. 

The user then looked at another PDF titled ""Redis + Python,"" which explains that Redis-py is the standard client for Python. They mentioned it's maintained by the Redis Company and listed a GitHub repo, with specific Python requirements. The query is about how many databases Redis supports in total.

In the context given earlier, when I read through each part, I found that from the first PDF, Redis has 16 default databases. Each of these can be referred to by their number from 0 to 15. So, adding all those numbers together gives me a total of 16. 

The other parts about Redis being an in-memory system and its durability features aren't directly related to the count of supported databases but describe how it works. The Python documentation on Redis-py also just mentions that Redis supports these 16 databases. Therefore, combining all this information, I conclude that Redis supports a total of 16 databases.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, it looks like there's a lot about Redis as an in-memory database system. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the context, I see a PDF titled ""Redis Database and Interaction."" It mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. That seems important. So, they have 16 different databases to work with. These are numbered from 0 to 15.

I also read about the characteristics of Redis as an in-memory system. They mention durability features like saving snapshots at specific intervals and appending-only files that can be rolled forward if there's a failure. That makes sense because having multiple databases (or nodes) would make data more resilient.

Additionally, the document talks about Redis being used for various models like KV store, graph, spatial, text search, vector, and time series. This tells me that Redis isn't just limited to traditional key-value stores but can handle a range of data types and structures efficiently.

Looking at the other files in the context, they all mention Redis as the primary database type. For example, ""Redis DB - Redis (Remote Directory Server)..."" reinforces the idea that Redis is the main player in this space. They also mention that Redis doesn't just handle lookup by keys; it can manage complex data with advanced features like time series or vector databases.

So putting this all together, Redis supports 16 different databases by default and uses various types of databases depending on the use case. The document provided is about how to connect to Redis through Docker containers, which tells me that Redis is accessible across multiple services but in a confined network unless configured otherwise.

Therefore, based on the PDF content, Redis primarily supports 16 databases, each representing different data models or functionalities.

Redis supports 16 default databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15 and are used for various data models including key-value stores, graphs, spatial data, text search, vector data, and time series. Redis is designed as an in-memory system with durability features like snapshotting and roll-forward capability for secondary storage failures.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. From the context provided, it looks like Redis is primarily a in-memory database system. It's considered an ""in-memory"" one because it can access data directly from the filesystem without needing a main storage device.

Looking at the context again, there are several sections that discuss Redis and its use cases. The first chunk mentions that Redis supports 16 databases by default, numbered 0 to 15. These are referred to as ""databases"" in general terms, even though each is an individual database. This makes me think that Redis uses these numbers (0-15) for easy reference within its system.

Additionally, there's a section about how Redis can be used with different data models and structures like graphs, spatial data, full-text search, vector spaces, time series data, etc. But the main point here is the number of supported databases. The first part specifically states that Redis provides 16 databases by default. So regardless of the specific model or structure, Redis has these 16.

I don't recall any other databases mentioned for Redis in the provided context. It doesn't talk about external storage solutions like HDFS, Elasticsearch, or Oracle. Since it's an in-memory system, those aren't supported, but the number of internal databases remains 16. 

So putting this together, Redis supports 16 databases in its default configuration. This seems consistent with what I've learned before about Redis being a versatile and widely used in-memory database.
