Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, it seems like the document is about a paper titled ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf."" Wait, that doesn't look right—it should probably be something like ""A Paper on Neo4j."" Anyway, focusing on the content: it mentions that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011. The context also explains that Neo4j was introduced to provide a SQL-equivalent language for graph databases, which is great because it helps businesses avoid SQL limitations and deal with complex data more effectively.

So the answer provided earlier just states the year as 2011 without any reasoning, but from the query, we're only asked about when Neo4j's query language was invented. The context doesn't mention the year directly except for mentioning the creation in 2011. Therefore, it seems like the information given is that Neo4j introduced its graph query language in 2011.

Wait a second, the initial answer I wrote said the query was about when Neo4j's query language was invented and the user might want more details on how it works or what specific features are included. But since the question only asks for the year, perhaps the answer is straightforward: it was created in 2011.

I think that's all I can get from the context provided. It's a bit confusing because the document title seems to be about the paper, but the actual information given is just the year.

The graph query language introduced by Neo4j was created in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. The user has given me a context that seems to outline some features of Neo4j but doesn't provide specific dates. Let me read through it again.

The context starts by mentioning the creation date of the graph query language in 2011 and mentions ""Goal: SQL-equivalent language for graph databases."" It also talks about Cypher, a visual way to match patterns and relationships (nodes), with :CONNECT_TO as an example. Then it lists several plugins like APOC, Neo4j’s Graph Data Science Plugin, and others that provide efficient graph algorithms.

Wait, the user's query is asking when Neo4j's graph query language was invented, but in the context provided, there are details about when Cypher was created (2011) and other plugins. There's no explicit mention of when Neo4j itself was developed or introduced as a graph query language.

From what I know, Neo4j is an open-source graph database company that started offering its services in 2007. The actual introduction of the Cypher query language for graphs might have been later, possibly around 2011 based on the context given. But since the context doesn't explicitly state the year when Neo4j was first introduced as a graph query language, I can't be certain.

I think it's reasonable to infer that Neo4j was introduced before APOC by providing Cypher and other plugins. So if the context indicates that Cypher was introduced in 2011 for SQL-equivalence, then Neo4j itself might have been introduced earlier than that. Maybe around 2007 when it started offering services.

But since there's no direct info on Neo4j's origin as a graph query language, I can only estimate based on the context provided. So my answer should state that Cypher was created in 2011 for SQL-equivalence but acknowledge that I don't have specific information about Neo4j's actual introduction.

The graph query language, Cypher, was introduced in 2011 as part of Neo4j's development to provide a visual and efficient way to match patterns and relationships (nodes) in graphs. However, the context does not provide specific dates for when Neo4j itself was introduced as a graph query language. 

Answer: The graph query language Cypher was created in 2011 for SQL-equivalence purposes in Neo4j, but the introduction of Neo4j itself as a service remains unclear without additional information."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. The context provided mentions a document titled ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" and gives some information about the history of Neo4j. Let me read through that again.

The text talks about how Neo4j was created in 2011, mentioning it as part of the Cypher language. It also states that the goal is to have a SQL-equivalent for graph databases and provides a visual way to match patterns and relationships using nodes connected by edges. There's some mention of APOC plugins and add-on libraries that expand on the capabilities of Cypher.

The query they're asking about is ""When was neo4j's graph query language invented?"" And the answer provided is the year 2011. That makes sense because the context clearly states that Neo4j was created in 2011, which I believe is its inception year for its graph query language.

I should make sure to interpret this correctly. The context does mention ""Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011,"" so that's the origin of Neo4j itself. They also talk about the goal being a SQL-equivalent, but I think the key information here is the year they were created.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be 2011.

The graph query language for Neo4j was invented in the year 2011.
