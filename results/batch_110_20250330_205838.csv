I don't know. The provided context does not mention AVL trees or rotations. It appears to be a collection of text snippets from various documents related to data replication, database consistency, and data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, and binary search trees). None of these topics seem relevant to the query about AVL tree imbalances requiring multiple rotations.|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The provided context does not mention AVL trees or their properties, including the requirements for multiple rotations. The topics discussed in the PDFs are related to data replication, monotonic read consistency, observations on arrays and linked lists, binary search tree, isolation levels in relational databases, and optimistic concurrency control in NoSQL databases. There is no information about AVL trees or their behavior.|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"I don't know.

The context provided appears to be related to NoSQL databases, concurrency, and database consistency models. There is no mention of AVL trees or their properties. Therefore, I am unable to provide a relevant answer to your query about AVL trees."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
