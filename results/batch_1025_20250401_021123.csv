Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

First, there's a PDF document titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" which mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. That seems clear. The database is numbered from 0 to 15, so each number corresponds to a unique database instance. So, that immediately gives me an answer: Redis supports 16 databases.

Then there's another document ""Redis + Python.pdf"" which has page 12 and 13. In page 12, it mentions that Redis is considered an in-memory database system and provides a set of language libraries for Python. On page 13, it talks about Redis being used in ML, mentioning a simplified example.

The other document ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 22 refers back to the previous point, reinforcing that there are 16 databases. Page 22 also mentions durability aspects and specific design features like snapshots and append-only operations, but those don't affect the count of supported databases.

On page 17, it ranks Redis among KV stores with a score of 0.26, which is about where I would find other in-memory systems like SQLite or PostgreSQL. However, that's more about popularity or usage context rather than database support count.

The ""Redis - It is considered an in-memory database system..."" page confirms the 16 databases point again. The example given on page 14 seems to be a simplified ML example but doesn't add to the number of supported databases.

There are no other mentions of Redis supporting more or different types of databases beyond what's mentioned. So, putting it all together, Redis supports exactly 16 databases as noted in the first document.

Alright, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me start by reading through each chunk carefully.

First, there's a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" with several pages. On page 22 and 17, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. The context says, ""Direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs (and variations).""

Then, another PDF titled ""Redis + Python.pdf"" on page 12 also states that Redis supports 16 databases. Additionally, there's a link provided from the first document to a source about feature stores, which again mentions 16.

Looking at other chunks, none of them discuss more than 16 databases. For example, some mention durability options and performance metrics but don't exceed that number. The question is about the total support for Redis in all these documents, so I think it's safe to conclude that Redis supports a total of 16 databases.

Redis supports a total of **16 databases**.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let's look through each part of the text step by step.

First, from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" there are chunks about Redis being the default number of databases, which is 16, numbered 0 to 15. That seems clear. Then in another section under NoSQL, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, so that confirms the count.

Looking further down, the last chunk from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" talks about durability features. It says Redis supports durability through snapshots and append-only files. But that doesn't affect the number of supported databases; it's more about how data is handled in case of failures.

There are also two PDFs related to Redis and Python: ""Redis + Python.pdf (page 12)"" and ""(page 14)"". In page 12, Redis is mentioned as being used with Python and supports various models like KV stores. Then in page 14, it refers to the source of Redis for DS/ML modeling, mentioning MadewithML.

Both PDFs don't provide additional info on the number of databases Redis supports; they focus more on integration and usage examples rather than database counts.
</think>

The context clearly states that Redis supports 16 databases numbered from 0 to 15. There is no mention of any other databases or limitations in this section, so the answer is straightforward.
