Okay, so I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for their values based on the provided context. Let me go through each part of the query and see which parts mention Redis data types.

First, the query is asking about the data types in Redis, specifically for values. Looking at the context, I see a few sections that talk about Redis as an in-memory database system. In page 19 of NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, it mentions that Redis Data Types are typically strings but can be any binary sequence. The values themselves include Strings, Lists (linked lists), Sets (unique unsorted string elements), Sorted Sets, Hashes (strings to strings), and Geospatial data.

Additionally, in page 22 of the same document, it further explains that Redis supports these types: 16 databases by default, numbered 0-15. Direct interaction is through commands for setting and getting k/v pairs or variations. It also mentions two other things: Redis.py Documentation with a full list, and Redis Command List which provides a filter to target the specific data structure.

Then, in page 17 of NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, it describes Redis as an open-source KV store that can be used with various models like graph, spatial, etc., but primarily supports a KV model. It also mentions ranking for KV stores: 18 on one page and 24 on another, which might refer to the number of rankings or something else.

In the next section from page 06 - Redis + Python.pdf, it lists Redis commands with bullet points (List > here <), providing a filtered list. The final part is about Redis being an in-memory system but supporting durability through snapshots or append-only files and mentions its speed and rich command list.

So, putting this together, the data types supported for values are: Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, Geospatial data. I don't see any mention of other types like Floats or Booleans here, so those aren't included unless they're treated as keys. Since the query is about values, which are the data that can be accessed and modified, not necessarily stored.

I think that's all from the context provided. I don't have access to external sources beyond what's in the given text, so I'll stick with what's there.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for their values are:

- **Strings**
- **Lists (linked lists)**
- **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements)
- **Sorted Sets** 
- **Hashes** (strings to strings)
- **Geospatial data**

These types support durability through snapshots or append-only files, and the document mentions that Redis supports various models like graph, spatial, etc., but primarily a KV store."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for their values based on the provided context. Let me read through each chunk carefully.

First, there's a document about Redis as an in-memory database system with durability features—like saving snapshots and append-only files. That mentions durability but doesn't directly talk about data types here.

Then there are two documents about Redis commands. The first one (page 17) lists Redis databases as KV stores but also notes that they can be used with various models like graphs, spatial, text search, etc. It says the ranking of KV stores is 0.24. This tells me that Redis supports multiple data models but primarily VCs.

The second document (page 22) talks about direct interaction commands related to setting and getting K/V pairs and variations. It mentions many language libraries available for interactions.

Looking at the third document, Redis Command List on page 3, it lists a full command list for various data structures like KV, hash, set, etc., but doesn't mention specific data types here. The documentation is extensive, but that's not directly relevant to the query about names of data types.

The fourth document (page 5) discusses Redis as an in-memory database system with durability features—essentially saving snapshots at intervals or append-only files for roll-forward if something fails. This information doesn't pertain to data types either.

Finally, page 18 mentions that Redis is considered an in-memory system but lacks complex data handling, only supporting lookup by key. So it's not a database that's specialized for managing very large datasets with complex structures.

The fifth document on page 19 discusses Redis as a KV store that doesn't support secondary indexes and has 100,000 set operations per second. Again, this is about the data model (KV) rather than specific data types names.

Putting it all together, the context isn't explicitly named or discussed in detail regarding which data types Redis supports. It does mention it's an KV store but doesn't provide a list of data types like strings, lists, sets, etc. The only relevant part is that Redis primarily supports VCs with durability features, but no specific names are given.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't see any explicit names listed for Redis data types related to value support. The context focuses more on its functionality and commands rather than naming the data types they handle.

The context does not explicitly list the data types supported by Redis for their values. Redis primarily supports VCs (Value and Key Stores) but lacks specific data type names in the provided information.

Alright, let's figure out how to answer this query. The user is asking me to name the data types supported by Redis for values based on a provided context.

First, I'll look through the context provided. It seems like there are multiple documents about Redis. On page 19, under ""Redis Data Types,"" it lists several data types including Strings, Lists (or Vectors), Sets, Sorted Sets, and Geospatial data with similarity. These seem to be the primary KV store types.

Then, on page 18 of the same document, it mentions Redis as an in-memory system supporting durability features like snapshots and append-only files. It also states that Redis is designed for simple lookups using keys and doesn't handle complex data. So it only supports lookup by key without any secondary indexes.

Looking further down, there's a section on ""Commands List"" where the user can find commands related to different KV structures like lists, hashes, sets, etc., but none mention other models like graphs or time series.

Therefore, combining both pieces of information—the main types listed and the lack thereof for complex data—I can conclude that Redis primarily supports Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, and Geospatial data. It doesn't handle more intricate data structures.

Redis is an in-memory database that primarily supports String, List (vector), Set, Sorted Set, and Geospatial data types. These are the primary KV store types it handles without supporting complex structures.
