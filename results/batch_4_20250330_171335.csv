Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Hmm, let me see... I remember that Neo4j is a graph database, but the question is about its query language itself, not just the database structure.

Looking at the context provided, it mentions that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011. Wait, where does that come from? The user gave me a PDF document about Neo4j and its query language. It says the document is ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011."" So it seems like that's the source of information.

But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. Maybe I should think about how I learned this before. In school, we studied databases, but I don't recall anything about a specific time when a particular language for graphs was created. I know SQL is for relational data, and Cypher must be the graph query language because it uses similar symbols to nodes in a graph.

So if the document states that Neo4j's cypher (Cypher) is created in 2011, then that would be the answer. It's possible that this information was compiled when I first learned about Neo4j because it might have been part of a lecture or a quick info sheet at the time.

Alternatively, maybe the document was written by someone who worked on Neo4j and included accurate dates from 2011. That would make sense given how documents are often presented in academic papers or technical manuals when first published to give readers up-to-date information.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier versions of Neo4j might have used older query languages, and now they use Cypher. But the question specifically asks about when Cypher was created, not about changes over time. So even if Neo4j evolved in other ways, the document's wording seems to directly state that Cypher was created in 2011.

So putting it all together, I think the answer is that Cypher (Neo4j's query language) was created in 2011. The context provided gives a clear and direct answer.

The document explicitly states that Neo4j's graph query language, referred to as Cypher, was created in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j and graph databases in general.

From the context provided, there's a PDF document titled ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011"". The page mentions that the goal is to create a SQL-equivalent language for graph databases. It also notes that the Cypher syntax was developed around 2011, which seems important.

The answer provided states that Neo4j's graph query language was invented around 2011 with the introduction of Cypher syntax by Robert Schreiber and Gagan Arora. So, based on this context, it looks like the key event is in 2011 when Cypher was created.

Wait, but I should make sure if there's any other information that might suggest a different year or maybe mention any other language features. The document also mentions APOC Plugin and the Graph Data Science Plug-in, which were added later, but those are about features of the existing language, not the creation time of Neo4j itself.

So, putting it together, Neo4j's graph query language was introduced around 2011 with the release of Cypher in 2011. The answer provided correctly references that. I don't think there's any other relevant information from the context to change this conclusion.

Neo4j's graph query language was introduced around 2011 using the Cypher syntax, developed by Robert Schreiber and Gagan Arora.

Alright, let me figure out how to approach this query. So, the user is asking when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. I remember that Neo4j is a graph database, and it has a graph query language. From what I recall, the original paper or document mentioned in the context is from 2011 about Cypher. It talks about how Cypher allows querying graphs visually by connecting nodes with relationships like :CONNECT_TO. So, if that's the origin of Neo4j's graph query language, then the answer should be 2011.

Wait, I should double-check to make sure there wasn't another version or a different document that might have a later year. But since the context is about 10 - Neo4j.pdf and the first line says ""Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011,"" that should be accurate. The rest of the context seems to describe various plugins and features but doesn't change the creation date of Cypher itself.

I also need to make sure I'm not confusing any other languages or technologies here. The answer is definitely about Neo4j's query language, which came out in 2011 with Cypher.

The graph query language of Neo4j was invented in 2011.
