"Based on the provided context, I can answer your question accurately.

According to page 4 of the document (chunk EC2 Lifecycle), the EC2 lifecycle refers to the following stages:

1. **Launch**: When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages describe the various states an EC2 instance can be in, from initial launch to termination or reboot."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, I found relevant information about EC2 from different pages of the ""EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" file.

According to page 4 (chunk EC2 Lifecycle), the EC2 lifecycle consists of four stages:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without affecting data on the root volume.

So, the EC2 lifecycle is comprised of these four stages: Launch, Start/Stop, Terminate, and Reboot."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
