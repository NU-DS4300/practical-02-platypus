"Based on the provided context, I can answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages or states that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through during its lifetime. According to the context, these stages are:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: You can temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently delete the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restart an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages are mentioned in various chunks from the PDF, but they all collectively describe the EC2 lifecycle."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, specifically from pages 4, 1, 3, and 7-9 of the ""EC2 & Lambda"" document, I can answer your query accurately.

The EC2 lifecycle refers to the various states an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can be in. According to the context, these states are:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These states are mentioned in various chunks throughout the document, which I've referenced to provide a comprehensive answer."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: You can temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance, allowing you to restart it later without losing any data on the root volume.
3. **Reboot**: You can restart an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: This is when you permanently delete the instance.

These lifecycle stages are mentioned in multiple contexts, including pages 4 and 12 of the ""EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" file, which seem to be relevant sources for this query."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
