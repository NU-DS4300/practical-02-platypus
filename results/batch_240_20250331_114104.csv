Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and other similar technologies.

First, I remember that Redis is a popular in-memory database system. From the context provided, it looks like Redis dates back quite a bit before 2014. In fact, one of the documents mentions that Redis was originally developed in C++ starting from 2009. That's way before the current year, which makes me think that Redis isn't that new.

Then there are some other technologies mentioned along with it. SQL Server is an older database system that Redis has been compared to since at least 2013. There's also PostgreSQL and MySQL, both of which were around for a while too, but the context doesn't go back much beyond the C++ versions.

I'm trying to remember if there are any other major technologies like MongoDB or MySQL that were active before Redis. I think MongoDB was around until 2013 or so, and MySQL has had various versions as well. But again, these are older technologies not related to Redis.

The document also mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system, which tells me it's not a traditional relational database. So it might have been around for several years before that. From what I've heard, Redis was used by companies like Spotify and Google, and they started using it starting from 2016 or so.

Looking back at the context, in the NoSQL Intro document (page 5), there's a section on Redis which says it dates back to 2009. That seems more specific than other documents I've seen mentioning Redis. So combining that with the information about being an open-source project started by the company in 2014, perhaps around 2009 or earlier.

Wait, but some sources suggest Redis was released around early 2016 to mid-2017. That makes sense because it's been around for a few years and has been adopted by larger companies as a cost-effective solution when traditional databases aren't sufficient.

I should also consider that the exact release date might be detailed in specific documentation or product releases, but based on the context provided, the information points to Redis being released before 2016.

Redis was developed initially in C++ starting from 2009 and has since been widely adopted. It is noted as an open-source project started by the company in early 2014. However, based on the context provided, it seems Redis dates back to around 2009 or earlier when it was part of an older implementation.

Answer: Redis was released around mid-2016 or early 2017."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the query and the provided text carefully.

The question is asking, ""When was Redis released?"" The answer provided in the context includes multiple paragraphs about Redis. Hmm, let's look at them one by one.

In the first part, there's a chunk from page 18, which says: ""Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database - Sometimes called a data structure store - Primarily a KV store, but can be used with other models: Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, Time Series."" It mentions Redis was originally developed in 2009. So that's an early year.

The next part is from page 17, which says: ""Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database - Sometimes called a data structure store - Primarily a KV store, but can be used with other models: Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, Time Series."" It also mentions Redis was originally developed in 2009. So again, the release year is 2009.

In another chunk from page 17, there's a note saying: ""Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database - Sometimes called a data structure store - Primarily a KV store, but can be used with other models: Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, Time Series."" Again, Redis was developed in 2009. 

In the later part of the query list, there's another chunk from page 14 that mentions redis/py is the standard client for Python. It also says redis is maintained by the Redis Company itself and refers to a GitHub repository: redis/redis-py. This further confirms Redis was developed in 2009.

Then there's a source mentioning Redis at madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/, but that seems unrelated to release dates. The similarity scores are provided as well, which seem low (like 0.44, 0.48), so it's not the main point we're looking for.

So all the relevant information points to Redis being developed in 2009. Even though there are other mentions about redis/py and Redis being maintained by the company, they don't add new information about when Redis was released.

Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the context provided. Let's look through the context step by step.

First, in the 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf file (page 18), it mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system but also notes that it supports durability features. It says Redis was originally developed in 2009 in C++. So I know Redis started back then.

Looking further down, under the ""from"" section for page 17, there's a bullet point about Redis being open-source and in-memory. The context also states it's primarily a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. That doesn't mention when it was released, only that it's been around since 2009.

Additionally, the ""with similarity"" numbers aren't directly relevant here. There are other files about Redis in different languages and projects, but none provide release dates beyond the initial information that it started in 2009.

So, putting this together, I can confidently say Redis was released in 2009.
