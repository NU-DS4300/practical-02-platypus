Alright, let me try to figure out how to answer this query. So, the user wants me to name the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context.

First, I should look at the context given about Redis Data Types. It mentions several key points: Values can be strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are string to string mappings), and geospatial data with a similarity score of 0.17. There's also a note that values can be any binary sequence.

I should make sure I include all the supported types mentioned in the context. That would be strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data as per point 20. Also, it mentions binary sequences for values, so I think that's another key here.

Wait, does ""binary sequence"" refer to individual fields within a tuple or the entire dataset? From what I remember, in Redis, tuples are used to store JSON objects. Each field is a string, and each can be an unbounded list of strings. So yes, binary sequences for values would include these lists.

Putting it all together, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. Strings
2. Lists
3. Sets
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (keyed-value storage)
6. Geospatial Data with similarity 0.17

I think that covers everything from point 18 to 20 in the context provided.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- Strings  
- Lists  
- Sets  
- Sorted Sets  
- Hashes (string â†’ string)  
- Geospatial data with a similarity score of 0.17  

These are all the key points mentioned from the context about Redis Data Types."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. From the context provided, it mentions several types like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. It also talks about geospatial data being a bit more complex with similarity levels.

Wait, but the query specifically asks to name the data types supported by Redis for values. The context includes some of these: strings are definitely one type there. Then it says lists (linked lists) which is another key type. Sets are unique and unsorted, so that's next. Sorted sets are similar but sorted in a specific order, I think.

Hashes can store any binary sequence, like integers or other keys, and each hash maps to a string value with similarity levels. So putting it all together, Redis supports strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes as the primary data types for storing values. But wait, what about more complex data structures? The context mentions geospatial data, which is a specific type of geospatial data. Geospatial data in Redis includes coordinates and areas with similarity levels. So that's another category.

So to answer the query accurately, I should list all these types: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. Each has its own specific use case depending on how the data is being stored or accessed.

The data types supported by Redis for storing values include:

1. **Strings**: These are basic text data types used frequently in various applications.
2. **Lists**: A collection of items where each item can be accessed and inserted, maintaining the order of insertion.
3. **Sets**: A collection of unique elements that do not maintain any order; duplicates are automatically removed.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintains order by inserting new elements only if they are not already present.
5. **Hashes (Hash Tables)**: These use a key-value storage mechanism where each key maps to a specific value, which can be a string or another hash table.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Redis supports geospatial data with similarity levels. Geospatial data includes coordinates and areas with associated similarities.

Each of these data types is designed for specific purposes and applications within the context of data storage and retrieval using Redis."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out which data types Redis supports for values. From what I remember, Redis has a specific set of data types they handle. Let me think... Oh right, it's called the Redis Value Type Definition (RVTD) or sometimes known as Redis Data Types. 

I think there are several categories here. The main ones are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. I'm a bit fuzzy on exact names though.

First, strings: I believe that's straightforward. They can be any binary string, so anything like a URL or an IP address would work. Then there's lists, which are like arrays in other languages. Each element is itself a list or array. Sets are more about unique elements, but they don't have a specific order and aren't sorted by default.

Sorted sets are similar to sets but each insertion maintains the order of their first occurrence. That's useful when you need something ordered. 

Hashes come next as strings that map keys (which can be any string) to values (another string). So, they're like dictionary literals in other languages.

Now, geospatial data is mentioned with a note about similarity and precision. I'm not entirely sure how it's handled, but I think it allows for spatial coordinates or similar structured data. Maybe integers representing latitude and longitude?

I also recall that Redis supports specific keywords for these types. Strings are straightforward. Lists are denoted with a curly brace on each side of the list elements. Sets have parentheses, and sorted sets use square brackets.

I'm not sure about hashes and geospatial data specifics, but I think it's better to stick with the categories mentioned and their representations as per the context provided.

So putting it all together, Redis supports strings (including various formats), lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are key-value pairs), and geospatial data. Each has its own syntax and use cases within the context of a NoSQL database setup.

Redis supports several data types for values, organized into categories based on their nature:

1. **Strings**: These can be any binary string and support various formats like URLs, IP addresses, etc.

2. **Lists**: Represent arrays where each element is itself a list or array.

3. **Sets**: Unique elements that are stored in an unordered manner; no duplicates allowed unless specified otherwise.

4. **Sorted Sets**: Maintain the order of their first occurrence upon insertion.

5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Key-value pairs where keys and values are strings, often used for mapping operations like lookups.

6. **Geospatial Data**: Supports geospatial data with keywords that may include similarity or precision, allowing spatial coordinates or structured data.

Each data type has specific syntax within Redis using curly braces { }, parentheses ( ), square brackets [ ], and parentheses () respectively."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
