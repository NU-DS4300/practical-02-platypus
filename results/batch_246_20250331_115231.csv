Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the context provided. Let me read through each paragraph carefully.

First, in the context about Redis as an in-memory database system, it mentions that it's originally developed in C++ starting in 2009. This is a key point because it tells me about Redis's history but doesn't specify when it was actually released on the market or made available to the public.

Next, there are two paragraphs about Redis being used with Python. The first one mentions that Redis-py is the standard client for Python maintained by Redis. It also lists some conda environment names and similarity scores of 0.50 and 0.51 respectively. These don't provide information on release dates either.

Looking at other sections, I see no additional context or related paragraphs that mention Redis being released beyond its development in C++. There are mentions of it as a KV store but not when it was first made available to the public.

Considering all the information given, the main release date is implied from the original C++ development. Since 2009 is the starting year and there's no specific release date mentioned for Redis itself outside its client implementations, I have to conclude that while Redis was created in 2009, it wasn't officially released as a software product until later when it became part of Python libraries like Redis-py.
</think>

Based on the context provided, Redis was initially developed in C++ starting from 2009. However, there is no explicit information about Redis being publicly released as a standalone software product. It was instead integrated into Python libraries such as Redis-py. Therefore, while Redis has its roots in development since 2009, it wasn't officially released as software until later when it became part of these implementations.

**Answer:** Redis was developed in C++ starting in 2009 but wasn't publicly released as a standalone software product until after the referenced Python libraries like Redis-py were integrated into their ecosystems."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. It's an in-memory database system, right? From the context provided, it mentions that Redis was originally developed in 2009 using C++. That gives me a starting point.

I remember seeing that Redis has been around for some time now. The first mention of Redis in the context is from a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 18, chunk Redis - It is considered an in-memory database system... They say it was developed in 2009. That seems pretty old, but I know that the concept behind Redis has been around for longer.

Then there's another PDF titled ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" which mentions Redis-py as the standard client for Python and it's maintained by Redis. The repository is at redis/redis-py, and in a 4300 Conda Environment, they have pip install redis. These indicate that Redis has been actively used and developed over time.

I also see that one of the PDFs (NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf) says Redis was primarily a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. This shows Redis isn't just for Key-Value pairs alone; it's versatile.

From what I know about software releases, older technologies often have different timelines than newer ones. Even though Redis is still in the early stages of development compared to modern databases, its initial concept was established around 2009. The fact that it has a large following and is used with various programming languages suggests it's been around longer than that.

I think about how software releases are tracked. Some companies might have milestones or phases where Redis reached out for release at specific times. However, without exact timeline data from the context provided, I can only go by what's stated. The information given seems to indicate Redis was released before 2009, specifically in 2009.

So putting it all together, considering Redis' original development year and its active use with various tools, I conclude that Redis was not widely released as a software system around the early 21st century. The initial version was from 2009, but it's been actively used in programming environments since then.

Redis was developed by IBM in 2009 as an in-memory database system originally focused on key-value store operations. While Redis has evolved beyond its original purpose, it remains active and is often referenced alongside modern databases due to its versatility across various data models."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Redis was actually released. Let me see... From the context provided, there are several documents and chunks that talk about Redis.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" document on page 18, it mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system with durability features. It says it supports snapshots to disk or can append-only files for roll-forward if something fails. Redis was originally developed in 2009 but is now integrated into Python and other languages.

Looking at another document ""Redis + Python.pdf"" on page 1, it clarifies that Redis-py is the standard client for Python and maintains the company itself. There's also a Conda Environment listed as 4300 which probably includes Redis-py in their packages.

In ""NoSQL Database and Interaction.pdf"", it states that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered 0 to 15, without any other names associated. It mentions direct interaction through commands related to KV pairs or variations and also libraries available.

So putting this together: Redis was originally started in 2009 but is now part of Python and has become a standard client. The context doesn't mention when Redis was released beyond being an open-source project that's integrated into these other languages, so it's likely that Redis itself was released as a separate entity around that time.

I should double-check if there's any information about Redis's official release date. From the context, I don't see specific dates for release, just mentions of its integration and durability features. So perhaps the answer is that Redis was integrated into Python and other languages but wasn't released on its own as a standalone project until later.

Wait, but in the context, it specifically says Redis-py is maintained by the company and has 16 databases. That suggests Redis itself was released around 2009 or earlier since it's no longer a separate entity beyond being a part of Python. So maybe the answer is that Redis was originally started in 2009 and became part of Python, but its release wasn't specified in the context provided.
</think>

Redis was originally started in 2009 as an open-source project aimed at creating an in-memory database. However, it has since become a component of other programming languages like Python, specifically through Redis-py. Despite not being released on its own as a standalone entity, Redis-py indicates that it's been integrated into Python over time.

Answer: Redis was initially started around 2009 and became part of Python (Redis-py) since then, but its official release wasn't specified in the provided context."|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
