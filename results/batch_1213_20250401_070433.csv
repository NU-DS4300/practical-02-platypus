"Based on the provided context, I can accurately answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various stages of an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance's life cycle. According to the text, these stages are:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages reflect the different operational states that an EC2 instance can be in, and they provide a clear understanding of how to manage and control instances throughout their life cycle."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, I can answer your query accurately.

The EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through during its lifetime. According to the context, these stages are:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.

These stages can be found in various chunks of the provided PDFs, including pages 4 and 7-10, with similarities ranging from 0.20 to 0.34.

Note that this information is specific to EC2 instances and not applicable to other AWS services or databases (e.g., relational or NoSQL)."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
