Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me go through each section and see if any mention this.

First, there's a section titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" which mentions Redis providing 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That sounds important because it gives a specific number of supported databases right away.

Looking further down in the same file, ""Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides..."" mentions that Redis interacts through commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs, which are often called ""k/d"" pairs or ""k/v"" pairs. It also lists some examples like KV store, graph, spatial, full text search, vector, and time series.

In the next section ""NoSQL Intro +KV DBs.pdf"", it continues with a ranking of KV stores: 18. That might be related to Redis's role in this category.

Then there are two PDF files on ""Redis + Python.pdf"": one at page 12 talks about Redis in context 13, and another at page 14 discusses Redis in DS/ML. Both sections mention that Redis supports various technologies, including ML and DS, which could imply a broader range of applications but not necessarily the number of databases.

The references provided are for FeatureStore and MadewithML, so they're probably related to the main topic of Redis's database support.

Putting it all together, the primary information given is in the first section where it explicitly states that Redis provides 16 databases by default. The other sections either provide additional context on how Redis works or its applications but don't add new numbers about the number of supported databases.

The number of databases Redis supports is explicitly stated as 16, numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through each section carefully.

First, there's a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" with page 22. It mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So that's a clear number here.

Then, the same document has another PDF on Redis DB at page 17. It says Redis is an open-source in-memory database and it can be used with various models like graph, spatial, full text search, etc., but the main point is it supports 16 databases as mentioned earlier.

Looking further down to ""Redis + Python.pdf"" at page 12, there's a chunk that talks about Redis in context 13. This seems to reinforce the information from the first PDF since it also mentions 16 databases.

In another part of the same document under section 06 on Redis + Python.pdf (page 13), there's a chunk discussing Redis in ML and DS/ML, with examples like simplified examples and links to other resources. The link points to Feature Store Explained and MADewithML, but again, that doesn't provide any new information about the number of Redis databases.

Then at page 14 of the same document, it references another source for Feature Store Explained on MADewithML's course. This seems like a step-by-step guide but still doesn't change the fact that Redis supports 16 databases.

So all the sources are consistent in stating that Redis provides 16 databases by default. There are no other numbers or variations mentioned, so I can confidently say that Redis supports exactly 16 databases.

Alright, let me figure out how to answer this query about how many databases Redis supports. 

First, I'll look through the context provided. The user gave a PDF snippet about Redis from two different files. In the first file, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It also clarifies that there's no other name associated with them, so Redis doesn't have an alternative name listed.

The second file is from a Python course using Madelyn & Make (MADAYLMS), and it talks about Redis being used in Data Science and Machine Learning contexts. However, the key point here is the number of databases Redis supports. The first PDF directly states that Redis offers 16 databases. 

I should make sure I'm not mixing up any details from the other files. The second file doesn't provide a count but discusses how Redis can be used in DS/ML models. So, focusing on Redis as an in-memory database, it clearly supports 16 different databases.

Wait, maybe there's more to consider? Are there any specific notes in the first PDF about Redis's capabilities or support for multiple models? No, I think that's covered by the initial info. It all points towards Redis supporting exactly 16 databases in its default configuration.
</think>

From the context provided, Redis supports 16 databases as per the information given in the first PDF snippet.
