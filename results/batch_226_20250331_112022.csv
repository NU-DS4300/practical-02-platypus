Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, I see that Neo4j was created in 2011, and it introduced Cypher as its query language. They also mentioned other plugins like APOC and the Graph Data Science Plugin.

First, I need to identify when Cypher was developed. The context talks about Neo4j's graph query language being created in 2011. So that's a clear answer for the question they asked: Cypher was introduced in 2011 as the graph query language for Neo4j.

I should make sure I'm not mixing up anything else from the context. The user specifically mentioned Neo4j, but it's also about its query language. Since the answer is based on when Cypher was created, that seems correct.

Additionally, the other plugins and their functionalities aren't directly relevant to the question of when Cypher was invented. They're just additional information provided in the context, so I can ignore them unless they come into play for another part of the query, but since it's about Neo4j's language, Cypher is the key point.

I also need to ensure that the answer is accurate based on the given context. The context clearly states that Neo4j was created in 2011 and that Cypher was introduced then as a graph query language. There's no conflicting information provided, so I can confidently say that Cypher was invented in 2011.

So, putting it all together, the answer is straightforward: Cypher was invented in 2011.

The graph query language Cypher was invented in 2011 as part of Neo4j."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Hmm, from what I remember, Neo4j is a graph database developed by Tomita Labs. They were working on something called the ""Query Language for Graph Databases,"" and they made that into an actual programming language in 2011. That's where Cypher came in.

Wait, so the user is asking about when this language was invented. I think it was invented when they started developing Cypher as a query language for Neo4j. So, that would be around 2011. They were trying to create a way to query graph databases efficiently and intuitively, which led to the creation of Cypher.

But just to make sure, is there any other angle here? Maybe older systems or older versions of Neo4j? I know they have different versions before 2011, but the question specifically mentions Neo4j's graph query language. So I think it was introduced in their first version, which was definitely after their initial research.

I remember reading that when they first started developing Cypher for their data integration solution, they recognized the need for a more intuitive way to work with graphs and found that implementing efficient querying wasn't straightforward. They had to figure out how to represent complex relationships in a query language that could handle graph structures effectively.

So putting it all together, Neo4j's graph query language was invented around 2011 when Tomita Labs started developing Cypher as the query language for their first version of the database.

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented in 2011. It was developed by Tomita Labs during their initial research to create an intuitive query language that efficiently handled graph databases."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. The context provided is a PDF called ""10 - Neo4j.pdf"" from page 2, chunk Neo4jâ€™s graph query language created in 2011. It mentions that the goal of the document is to provide a SQL-equivalent language for graph databases, not just for relational databases but specifically for NoSQL ones as well.

Looking at the section about Cypher, it says that the original query language was created in 2011. So, I'm thinking that Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was developed back then. 

I should also check if any other parts of the document mention when this was introduced. The context only includes a specific section about Cypher and mentions the creation year. There are references to the APOC plugin and other plugins for graph databases, but those are separate features.

Therefore, based on the information given in ""10 - Neo4j.pdf,"" the Cypher language, which serves as the query language for Neo4j, was invented in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was introduced in **2011**."|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
