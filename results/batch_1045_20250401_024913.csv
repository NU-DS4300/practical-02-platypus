"According to the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages that an instance goes through from creation to termination. These stages are:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This stage allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: This is the stage where the instance is permanently deleted.
4. **Reboot**: This stage restarts an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages collectively make up the EC2 lifecycle, which enables you to manage your instances effectively in Amazon Web Services (AWS)."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"According to the provided context from the PDF documents related to Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically pages 4, 1, 3, and 7-8, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages an instance goes through during its lifetime. These stages are:

1. **Launch**: When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.

This is what I would consider the EC2 lifecycle, based on the context provided."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
