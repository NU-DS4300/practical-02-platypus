Alright, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant section step by step.

First, looking at the context, there are a few sections related to Redis. The first one is about NoSQL databases and Redis. It mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases, numbered from 0 to 15. There's also a mention of Redis being maintained by the company itself and references to GitHub and a conda environment. However, this section doesn't specify when Redis was released.

Next, there's another part about Redis in Python. This section talks about Redis being used with Python, mentioning it as the standard client for Python. It also provides details about the repository and an environment setup. Again, nothing is said about release date here.

The third point from this section describes Redis as an in-memory database system that supports durability through snapshots or append-only files. It explains that originally developed in C++ but can be very fast with operations like SET exceeding 100,000 per second. This information gives context on Redis's current capabilities and performance.

Looking further down, there are more mentions of Redis being used in various contexts, including as a KV store for graph data or time series data. These again don't include any specific release dates.

Putting it all together, the only specific mention related to Redis's release is that it was originally developed in C++. There's no information provided about when it was released officially. The context doesn't clarify that Redis has been around longer than 10 years or if there were public releases before its use with Python and other technologies.

Therefore, based on the given data, I can't find any explicit release date mentioned for Redis. It seems like Redis has evolved since then, even though no official release dates are provided.

The context does not provide an explicit release date for Redis. It mentions that Redis was developed in C++ and discusses its current capabilities but lacks details on when it was released officially.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me go through each of the provided documents and see if any mention release dates.

First document is about NoSQL introduction with KV databases. It mentions Redis as a data structure store in the section ""Redis Database and Interaction."" It says they provide 16 default databases, numbered 0 to 15. But it doesn't specify when Redis was released or its version number yet. The next document discusses Redis in Python, specifically using Redis.py documentation, which is an open-source library for Python.

Looking at that section, it lists Redis commands with a full list on Slide 4 and uses Redis.py documentation on Slide 5. It also talks about Redis being a client for Python but doesn't mention when it was released or version.

Another document in the NoSQL section discusses Redis as an in-memory database system, mentioning Redis was developed in C++ starting from 2009. The next slide mentions that Redis can handle simple tasks but lacks complex data processing. There's no mention of release date here either.

The last document talks about Redis being used in Docker setup and provides a step-by-step guide on setting it up, mentioning the port number 6379. It doesn't include a release date or version information.

So, out of all these documents, only ""Redis + Python.pdf"" (page 12) mentions Redis is an open-source library for Python. The other documents focus more on the Redis itself without details about when it was released.
</think>

Based on the provided context, the primary document that discusses Redis and its release is ""Redis + Python.pdf."" This section mentions that Redis is an open-source Python library, which implies that Redis itself might be a client or part of a system that's widely used. However, there is no explicit information about when Redis was released or its specific version. 

Since Redis was introduced in 2009 as a data structure store but this is discussed more in the context of how it's used alongside Python and Docker, the release date for Redis isn't explicitly provided in the given documents.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me go through each of the provided documents and see if any mention the release date.

First, looking at document 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17), it mentions Redis is an in-memory database system but doesn't specify a release date. It does say Redis provides 16 databases by default with durability options like snapshots or append-only files and supports millions of operations per second.

Next, document 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 18) talks about Redis's original development in C++, starting around 2009. It also mentions that Redis has been maintained by the Redis Company since then.

Then, document 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 1) refers to Redis as the standard client for Python and says it's maintained by the Redis Company themselves. This further corroborates the information from page 18.

The other documents like 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (pages 22, 19, etc.) discuss Redis' data types, setting up Redis in Docker, its use in data science and machine learning contexts, and even mentioningMadWiki with ML course context. None of these directly address the release date.

Looking at all the documents together, I see that most provide information about Redis being a C++-based system started in 2009 and maintained by the Redis Company since then. The documentation pages don't mention when Redis was released per se, just its development timeline.
</think>

Redis was developed as a C++-based in-memory database starting in 2009 and has been maintained by the Redis Company ever since.

Answer: Redis was first released as a C++-based system in 2009. It was later maintained by the Redis Company, continuing to evolve over time."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
