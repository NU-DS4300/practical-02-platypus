"A query that gets to the heart of Redis's design!

According to the context, on page 22 of ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", it is stated that ""Redis provides 16 databases by default - They are numbered 0 to 15"". Therefore, my answer is:

**Redis supports 16 databases by default.**

These databases are numbered from 0 to 15 and can be interacted with using a set of commands related to setting and getting key-value pairs (and variations)."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

    not relevant to the query, say that, then answer to the best of your ability anyways."|How many databases does Redis support?
