"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages or states that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can go through:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This stage allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance, effectively stopping it from running. You can then restart the instance at a later time.
3. **Terminate**: This is the permanent deletion of the instance, effectively shutting it down and removing it from your AWS account.
4. **Reboot**: This stage allows you to restart an instance without losing data on its root volume.

These four stages collectively make up the EC2 lifecycle, which describes the various states that an EC2 instance can occupy during its lifetime in your AWS account."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"According to the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various states that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can be in. These states are:

1. **Launch**: This is when starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This state allows temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: This is the permanent deletion of the instance.
4. **Reboot**: This state restarts an instance without affecting data on the root volume.

In summary, the EC2 lifecycle tracks the various states that an Amazon EC2 instance can be in, from launching and starting/stopping to terminating and rebooting."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that:

The EC2 lifecycle refers to the various states or phases that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through during its lifetime. These phases are:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This phase allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance, effectively ""pausing"" it.
3. **Terminate**: In this phase, you permanently delete the instance, ending its life cycle.
4. **Reboot**: This is when you restart an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.

These lifecycle phases provide flexibility and control over EC2 instances, allowing you to manage their usage and availability according to your needs."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
