Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let's go through each relevant section step by step.

First, in the NoSQL Intro section of the first PDF, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That part is pretty straightforward. So right there, I can note down that Redis supports 16 databases.

Then, in the second document about Redis DB on DBEngines.com, it says there are 23KV stores, which means it's a KV store. But that doesn't directly answer how many databases it supports; it just explains what kind of database Redis typically is.

Looking at the third PDF titled ""Redis + Python,"" pages 12 and onwards discuss how Redis can be used in ML and DS/ML contexts. It mentions simplifying examples, but again, this section doesn't specify the number of supported databases beyond the initial 16 from the first PDF.

I don't see any other information about Redis's database count elsewhere in the context provided. So, combining all these points, it seems clear that Redis supports exactly 16 databases by default.

The query asks for the number of databases Redis supports. 

Based on the provided context:

- The first document mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default (numbered 0 to 15).
- Other documents discussing Redis in different contexts (like ML and DS/ML) provide more details about its use but do not specify the exact number of supported databases.

Therefore, the answer is:

Redis supports exactly 16 databases."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through each chunk carefully.

First, there's a chunk about Redis as an in-memory database system that can be very fast, supporting up to 100,000 set operations per second and being able to handle complex data like geospatial information. But it doesn't support secondary indexes or secondary keys; it only supports lookup by key.

Then, I see another chunk from a document about Redis's database features. It mentions that Redis is primarily a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc., and it has a rich collection of commands for each model. It also lists common operations such as set, key-value lookups, concatenation, filtering, sorting, and aggregating.

Looking at the subsequent chunks from two different documents about Redis in Python: one on the standard client for Python by Redis, another on how to connect Docker containers using Redis with specific commands like decode_responses=True. These don't seem directly relevant to counting the number of databases Redis supports.

In the end, the query is asking specifically about how many databases Redis supports, and the answer provided gives a list of supported database IDs from 0 to 15, which means Redis has 16 databases in total. The context confirms that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered 0 through 15.

I should make sure I'm not missing any other sources that might mention Redis's capabilities beyond the main point about supporting multiple databases. From all these chunks, the key information is that Redis supports 16 databases. I don't think there are any other documents or contexts that add more to this number.

The context indicates that Redis supports 16 databases in total. These are numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me look at the context provided. The query is asking specifically about the number of databases Redis provides.

First, I'll scan through the text. It mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. This is clearly stated in line with the information. Then, there's a section about Redis being an in-memory database system and its durability features, but that doesn't directly answer how many databases it supports.

Looking at other parts of the context, I see references to libraries available as well, like Python's Redis. But those are about supporting multiple models beyond KV stores, not about the number of databases Redis itself provides.

I don't find any mention of Redis having more than 16 distinct databases in this section. The only part that mentions supports is ""They are numbered 0 to 15,"" which directly states the count without adding or subtracting anything else.

So, putting it all together, Redis primarily supports 16 databases by default, and while other contexts might discuss its durability features or integration with different programming languages, they don't change that number. Therefore, the answer should be 16.
