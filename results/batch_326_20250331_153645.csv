I don't know. The provided context appears to be about database concepts, replication, consistency, graph data models, and relational databases, but it does not mention AVL trees or any related topics. Therefore, I am unable to answer the query accurately.|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to database systems, graph databases, and relational models, but it does not contain information about AVL trees or their rotation mechanisms. Therefore, I cannot provide a accurate answer to the query about imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
