"Based on the provided context, I can answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various stages an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through during its existence. These stages are:

1. **Launch**: When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance, allowing you to restart it later.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently delete the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restart an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages are mentioned in the context on page 5 of the ""EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" document with a similarity score of 0.40, which suggests that this information is accurate and relevant to the query."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"According to the provided context, specifically from page 4 of ""EC2 & Lambda.pdf"", the EC2 lifecycle refers to four stages:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This stage allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance. You can think of it as pausing the instance without shutting it down completely.
3. **Reboot**: In this stage, you restart an instance without affecting the data on the root volume. This is useful for troubleshooting or maintenance purposes.
4. **Terminate**: This is the final stage where you permanently delete the instance.

These four stages make up the EC2 lifecycle, allowing you to manage your instances effectively and efficiently."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that the EC2 lifecycle consists of the following stages:

1. Launch - This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. Start/Stop - This allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
3. Reboot - This restarts an instance without losing data on the root volume.
4. Terminate - This permanently deletes the instance.

These stages are described in the context provided, specifically in the chunk ""EC2 Lifecycle"" from page 4 of the PDF."|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
