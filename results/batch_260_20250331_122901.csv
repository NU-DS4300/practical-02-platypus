"I apologize, but the context provided does not seem to be relevant to the query about AVL trees. The context appears to be related to relational databases, NoSQL databases, and data replication.

However, I'll do my best to provide a general answer to the question.

In an AVL tree, imbalances occur when the height of one subtree differs from the height of the other subtree by more than one level. To maintain the balance property of the AVL tree, rotations are performed to restore the balance. There are two types of rotations: left rotation and right rotation.

The following imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations:

1. Left-left imbalance: When the root node is a left child of its parent, and the left subtree has another left child, this creates a left-left imbalance. To correct this, you would need to perform two consecutive left rotations.
2. Right-right imbalance: Similar to the above case, when the root node is a right child of its parent, and the right subtree has another right child, this creates a right-right imbalance. To correct this, you would also need to perform two consecutive right rotations.

In both cases, multiple rotations are necessary to restore the balance property of the AVL tree.

"I must say that the context provided does not seem to be related to the query about AVL trees. The queries appear to be about relational databases, NoSQL databases, and data replication, which is a different topic altogether.

However, I'll answer the query to the best of my ability, even though it's outside the given context.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that requires rotations to maintain its balance property. There are two types of imbalances that require multiple rotations:

1. Left-left imbalance: When a node's left child is also a left child of its own left child (i.e., a ""left-left"" or ""LL"" case), the AVL tree becomes unbalanced. In this case, three rotations are required to balance the tree.
2. Right-right imbalance: Similarly, when a node's right child is also a right child of its own right child (i.e., a ""right-right"" or ""RR"" case), the AVL tree requires multiple rotations to regain balance.

In both cases, the imbalances require two rotations to balance the tree, not just one. The rotations are performed recursively until the tree is balanced again."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"I must say that the query seems unrelated to the provided context, which appears to be about relational databases, NoSQL databases, and AWS. The context doesn't mention AVL trees or data structures at all.

However, I'll try to answer the question to the best of my ability, even if it's not directly related to the provided context.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that requires rotations to maintain its balance property. There are two types of imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-left imbalance**: When a node has two child nodes and both are left children, it's considered an imbalance. In this case, the tree needs to perform a right rotation at the root node and then a left rotation on the same node.
2. **Right-right imbalance**: Similar to the above case, when a node has two child nodes and both are right children, it's considered an imbalance. The tree needs to perform a left rotation at the root node and then a right rotation on the same node.

In both cases, multiple rotations are required to restore the balance property of the AVL tree.
