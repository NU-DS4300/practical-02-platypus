"Based on the provided context, I can answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different states or stages an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can go through. According to the context, these stages include:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages collectively make up the EC2 lifecycle, which allows users to manage and control their EC2 instances as needed."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"According to the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through during its lifetime. These stages are:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance. This allows you to pause and resume your EC2 instance as needed.
3. **Reboot**: Restart an instance without affecting data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: Permanently delete the instance, which will also terminate any associated resources.

These stages define the lifecycle of an EC2 instance, allowing you to manage your instances effectively throughout their duration."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
