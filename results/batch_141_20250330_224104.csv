"Based on the provided context from the EC2 & Lambda PDFs, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various states or stages that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can be in. These stages are:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.

These lifecycle stages are mentioned across different pages of the PDFs, indicating their significance and relevance to understanding EC2 instances."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various states an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can be in:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without affecting data on the root volume.

These states are mentioned in various chunks from the provided PDFs, specifically:

* From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf (page 4, chunk EC2 Lifecycle)
* From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf (page 7, chunk Letâ€™s Spin Up an EC2 Instance)

The context also provides information about EC2 features and pricing, but the specific question being asked is about the EC2 lifecycle."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, specifically from page 4 of ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf"", the EC2 lifecycle consists of four stages:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.

These stages are highlighted in bold on page 4, chunk EC2 Lifecycle."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
