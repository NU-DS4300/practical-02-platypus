Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking about when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. The context they provided mentions a PDF document on pages 2 and 3 of ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher"". 

Hmm, I remember that Neo4j is an open-source project focused on graph databases. It was created in 2011. The document talks about the creation of Cypher, which is the query language. The page mentions a goal related to making SQL suitable for graph databases and providing efficient graph algorithms.

I think the key here is that Neo4j's development started around 2011 with the creation of Cypher. So, when someone asked about when Neo4j's graph query language was invented, I can confidently say it was in 2011.

The query language Cypher was introduced in 2011 by Neo4j, so that's when Neo4J's graph query language was created.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Hmm, looking at the context provided, it mentions that Neo4j is a graph database created in 2011 with Cypher as its query language. The context also talks about other plugins and features like APOC, which are related to graph operations but doesn't directly mention the query language's invention.

Wait, I remember from my studies that the first version of Neo4j was released in 2011 using Cypher for querying graphs. But when exactly was the question ""when was neo4j's graph query language invented?"" asked? It seems like the context already provided some information about how Neo4j works with plugins, but not the exact invention date.

I should probably check the source of that 2011 release. If it's from a conference paper or documentation, I might find a reference to when the Cypher query language was introduced. But since the answer given in the context just states that Neo4j is created in 2011 with Cypher, maybe they're assuming that was the year the language was first defined.

Alternatively, perhaps the original question was a bit vague and refers to the creation of Neo4j rather than the invention of its query language. If that's the case, then the answer would be 2011, acknowledging that Neo4j itself wasn't invented by anyone but was created by organizations like Knime.

But wait, the context does mention Cypher as a tool used in Neo4j. Maybe it doesn't provide information on when the query language was actually introduced because it's part of the design and not necessarily an innovation. So perhaps the answer can just cite that Neo4j is 2011 and that Cypher was its query language, pointing to the 2011 release as the source.

So putting it all together, the answer would be that Neo4j was created in 2011 using Cypher as its query language. Even though I'm not certain if Cypher is the actual invention or just a tool used, the context gives us the year when Neo4j became available.

The creation of Neo4j was in 2011, with Cypher serving as its query language.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, it seems like there are some documents about Neo4J, but they don't specify an invention date. Instead, the document mentions that the query language was created in 2011 and talks about its history. The answer section just says ""I don’t know"" for the insertion point.

So, the user provided a query asking when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Since I can't find any mention of an invention date in the context given, my best guess is that there's no information available. Therefore, I should respond by saying 'I don't know' because neither does the provided text specify when it was created.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The document mentions that Neo4j's graph query language was ""created in 2011."" That could imply that 2011 is when it started being used or developed? But the question is about when it was invented, not when it became widely used. In发明 dates, you usually look for creation time. Since there's no info here, I have to stick with 'I don't know.'

I should also consider if any other parts of the context might give me clues. The document talks about Cypher and plugins but doesn't mention an invention date. So again, it seems like there's no data on when Neo4j's query language was first created or invented.

Therefore, my answer should reflect that I don't have information from the provided context to answer the question accurately.
