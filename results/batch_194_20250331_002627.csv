Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees and the factors that affect their balance.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node maintains two heights: one for the left subtree and another for the right subtree. The key property is that the height of the left subtree must be at least as tall as the right subtree for every node, maintaining an overall balance factor that ensures equal or more balanced subtrees.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree occur when a node's left and right heights differ by more than one. This imbalance can cause issues with the tree's efficiency because multiple rotations are needed to restore the balance. 

The first time this happens is usually during insertion. When inserting a new element, especially at the root, it might create an unbalanced node. For example, if I insert a large number like 10 into an AVL tree where all other nodes are smaller and balanced, the height difference increases on both sides. At this point, one rotation is enough to rebalance.

But what about subsequent imbalances? Let's say after insertion, inserting another element might create a situation where two rotations are needed. For instance, if I have two consecutive insertions that each cause an imbalance, it could require multiple rotations. 

Wait, let me think about specific examples. If during insertion, the first node is inserted into a spot where both sides are one level deep, then inserting another element might push the tree further down. In such cases, to fix the balance, I might need to move a higher value up or adjust pointers to maintain the balance.

Another scenario could be when dealing with a complex case like when two consecutive inserts each cause an imbalance, requiring two rotations instead of one. Or perhaps during deletion, especially in a corner case where two deletions lead to multiple insertions that create imbalances needing multiple rotations.

I should also consider other operations beyond just insertion. Deletion can sometimes cause similar issues if the node being deleted leads to a chain of imbalances when another element is inserted later. 

So, putting it all together, the main types of imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations are those that occur after more than one insertion, especially where two consecutive insertions create an imbalance that necessitates rebalancing through two rotations.

The type of imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations typically arise after more than one insertion. These imbalances occur when inserting elements cause the tree to become unbalanced on both sides, requiring two separate rotations to restore balance.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Insertion Leading to Imbalance:** Inserting a value may create an AVL imbalance, requiring one rotation for correction.
2. **Consecutive Insertions:** Subsequent insertions can cause the tree to develop additional imbalances that were not present before, necessitating another rotation.
3. **Corner Cases and Complex Operations:** Deletion or other operations might lead to multiple subsequent insertions causing imbalances, each requiring a rotation.

**Final Answer:**
Imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur after more than one insertion, particularly when two consecutive inserts create unbalanced subtrees, necessitating two rotations."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Hmm, first, let me make sure I understand the question correctly. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which helps maintain efficient operations like search and insertions.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree can occur when certain conditions aren't met. Specifically, if the balance factor (the difference between the heights of the right and left subtrees) becomes greater than 1 or less than -1, the tree is considered unbalanced. This imbalance leads to issues like node loss and increased search times.

The question asks about imbalances that require multiple rotations to fix. Rotations are essentially the operations needed to rebalance the tree after an insertion or deletion. I remember that when a subtree becomes too deep, causing an imbalance in its parent node, we perform a rotation either on the left or right child of that node. But sometimes, this might require more than just one such operation.

I recall that if there are two levels of imbalance (i.e., both the left and right subtrees are unbalanced), then a single rotation isn't sufficient to restore balance. Instead, multiple rotations are required. For example, suppose both the left child's subtree and its parent have high imbalance, but only the right child is problematic in another way. In that case, you might need a double rotation—perhaps rotating right or left twice—to bring the tree back into balance.

So, putting it all together, imbalances that require multiple rotations are those where both the current node's subtree and its parent's subtree are unbalanced to the point of causing height differences exceeding one. This situation necessitates more than one rotation step to fix.

Imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when two levels of imbalance exist. Specifically, if both the left child's subtree and the parent node itself have significant imbalances, a single rotation isn't enough to restore balance. In such cases, two rotations are necessary to correct the structure.

**Answer:** Imbalances requiring multiple rotations in an AVL tree are those where both the current node's and its parent's subtrees exhibit imbalance that necessitates two rotations for rebalancing."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The user is asking about what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. I remember that AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. So they maintain a balance factor which can be -1, 0, or +1.

First, I need to recall what causes imbalance in an AVL tree. If it's not balanced, either the left subtree is deeper than the right or vice versa. This imbalance leads to situations where certain operations like search and insertions might cause errors because the BST property isn't maintained anymore.

Now, when this happens, the tree needs rebalancing. The question is about imbalances that require multiple rotations. I think a common example here is a scenario where a node has three consecutive nodes on one side. For instance, if I have a right-skewed tree with root A, and its left child B which points to C as a right child. If I insert an element that should go into the left subtree but ends up in the right, it causes a chain of rotations.

So, let's break it down:

1. **Insertion at Node B**: When inserting into node B, we look for where to place the new value. Since both A and C are on the right side of B, adding something to B would go to the left subtree of B.
2. **Checking Balance Factor**: The balance factor for B becomes -1 (since its height increases by one). But if the existing nodes C's insertion caused issues earlier, it might have been another node that was too deep on one side.
3. **Rotation Needed**: To fix this, we perform a rotation at B. Since the right child C is deeper than the left child A, we rotate C up to become the new root of B's subtree. This takes two rotations because B now has balanced heights.

Another point is the concept of ""left-heavy"" trees. If a node's right subtree is much deeper than its left, inserting into the node can cause it to be moved one level higher on the left. In such cases, we perform a single rotation (right) at that node to correct the balance. However, this might not fully resolve all issues because other nodes could still be too deep.

Additionally, I remember that in some implementations of AVL trees, when two consecutive insertions create an imbalance, it's resolved by rotating upwards until the tree is balanced again. This process involves multiple rotations if several levels need to adjust their heights.

So putting it all together, the imbalances that require multiple rotations are those where inserting a new node causes one side (left or right) to become significantly taller than the other. This leads to two or more rotations at different nodes to rebalance the tree.
</think>

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when inserting a new node creates a situation where one subtree becomes significantly deeper than the other, requiring adjustments through rotations.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding AVL Tree Balance:** An AVL tree ensures its left and right subtrees are not too different in height (difference of at most 1). If this isn't maintained, it leads to imbalance.

2. **Insertion Scenario:** When inserting into a node causes one side (left or right) to be deeper, the tree becomes unbalanced.

3. **Balancing with Rotations:**
   - Two rotations are needed when an insertion creates more than two levels of imbalance.
   - This occurs at nodes where the subtree on either side is significantly taller.

4. **Example:** A root node (A) with left child B pointing to a deeper right subtree C. Inserting into B moves it left, causing C to be too deep. Rotating C up brings it closer, and another rotation fixes the issue.

**Answer:**
