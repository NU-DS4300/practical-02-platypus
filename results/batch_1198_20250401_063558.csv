Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the context provided. Let me go through each chunk of information step by step.

First, looking at the context, it mentions ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12, chunk Redis in Context 13)"". That might indicate that this is a specific page or section within the PDF about Redis and Python. I don't see any dates mentioned here directly.

Then there's another chunk from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17, chunk Redis DB - Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database - Sometimes called a data structure store - Primarily a KV store, but can be used with other models: Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, Time Series - From db-engines.com Ranking of KV Stores: 18) with similarity 0.28"". This part also doesn't mention release dates.

Further down, there's a PDF titled ""Redis + Python.pdf"" on page 14, which is linked to the source from MADIA MLOPS. It says Redis is maintained by the Redis Company and GitHub has redis/redis-py. Also, in their conda environment, they have Redis installed with specific packages like Redis, Redis-py, etc.

But none of these seem to provide a release date. The context might be part of a larger document where each section talks about different aspects of Redis, but without any explicit dates or versions mentioned in the text itself, it's hard to pinpoint when Redis was released as a standalone software product.
</think>

Based on the provided context, there is no information regarding the release date of Redis. The documents discuss Redis and Python together, mentioning its use with other models like Graph, Spatial, Vector, etc., but do not include any dates or release details. Therefore, it's not possible to determine when Redis was officially released from the given content.

Answer: Redis was not mentioned in the provided context as having a specific release date."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

    not relevant to the query, say that, then answer to the best of your ability anyways."|When was Redis released?

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was first released. I remember that Redis has been around for a while now, especially since it's become popular in data engineering and machine learning. From the context provided, there are several documents about Redis, but none mention the exact release date.

Looking at the context, I see several PDFs discussing Redis. One is called ""Redis + Python.pdf"" on page 12 of Volume 13. The other mentions Redis being introduced as a KV store in Volume 15 of a different document. There's also one from Volume 0 with a link to the official docs.

I don't see any information about when Redis was released in these documents. They all just talk about its features and usage in specific contexts. Since it's an open-source project, I assume it's been around longer than a few years but not releasing a formal release date mentioned here.

So, putting that together, without explicit dates in the context provided, I should probably state that Redis was released long before the documents were written. Maybe around 2009 or earlier when it started developing.
</think>

Redis was first released around 2009 and has been maintained by the Redis Company ever since."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released. I remember seeing some context about Redis in various documents and books about ML or feature stores. Let me go through the provided context.

Looking at the first part, there's a link pointing to ""madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/"", which is about using Redis for machine learning. The query on that page was ""When was Redis released?"" So it seems they're probably referring to when the feature store uses Redis came into being or was developed.

Then there are chunks from different sections discussing Redis. One mentions Redis in DS/ML 15, another discusses Redis as a KV store in Mlops, and yet another says Redis is maintained by Redis Company itself. Also, in one document it's called an in-memory database system but supports durability with snapshots or append-only files.

I know that Redis was released in 2009, specifically version 1.x, before its name changed to 6.x. So the release date would be 2009.
</think>

Redis was introduced in 2009 as version 1.x and later renamed to Redis 6.x in 2014. Therefore, the answer is:

 Redis was released in 2009."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo. You are also an expert in AWS as a service.
