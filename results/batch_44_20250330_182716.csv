"A question that gets to the heart of balanced binary search trees!

According to the context, I don't see any direct relevance to AVL trees or their balancing mechanisms. However, I'll do my best to provide an answer based on my knowledge of data structures.

In an AVL tree, imbalances occur when the height difference between two child nodes exceeds a certain threshold (usually 1). When this happens, the tree needs to be rebalanced to maintain its balance property.

There are two types of imbalances that require multiple rotations in an AVL tree:

1. **Left-left imbalance**: This occurs when both the left child and the grandchild of a node are taller than their parents. To fix this, you need to perform a right rotation at the node, followed by a left rotation on its left child.
2. **Right-right imbalance**: This occurs when both the right child and the grandchild of a node are taller than their parents. To fix this, you need to perform a left rotation at the node, followed by a right rotation on its right child.

In general, an AVL tree will require multiple rotations when there is a long chain of nodes with alternating left and right imbalances. In such cases, you may need to apply a combination of left and right rotations to restore balance.

"A nice question!

To answer this, I'll have to dig into my knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most one. This balancing property is maintained through rotations when necessary.

In an AVL tree, there are two types of imbalances:

1. **Left-heavy**: When the left subtree of a node has more nodes than its right subtree, or vice versa (right-heavy). In this case, the tree needs to perform a rotation to rebalance it.
2. **Right-left heavy**: This occurs when the left child of a node is left-heavy and the right child of that node is right-heavy. Similarly, if the right child of a node is left-heavy and the left child is right-heavy.

To address these imbalances, the AVL tree performs two types of rotations:

1. **Left rotation**: When the left subtree is heavier than the right subtree.
2. **Right rotation**: When the right subtree is heavier than the left subtree.

In both cases, a single rotation is sufficient to rebalance the tree. However, when there's a right-left heavy imbalance (e.g., the left child of a node is left-heavy and the right child is right-heavy), two rotations are required:

1. **Left-right rotation**: Rotate the right child of the node to the left.
2. **Right-left rotation**: Rotate the left child of the node to the right.

So, to summarize: multiple rotations (two) are required in an AVL tree when there's a right-left heavy imbalance."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"I must say that the context provided seems unrelated to the query about AVL trees. The topics discussed include NoSQL databases, concurrency control, ACID compliance, and relational databases, but none of these are directly related to AVL trees.

Therefore, I will answer the question based on my knowledge of data structures in general. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that requires rotations when certain imbalances occur. Specifically, an AVL tree requires two types of rotations:

1. Left rotation: This occurs when the left subtree of a node becomes too tall, i.e., its height exceeds the height of the right subtree by more than one level.
2. Right rotation: This occurs when the right subtree of a node becomes too tall.

When these imbalances occur, the tree needs to be rotated to restore balance and maintain the properties of an AVL tree, which include:

* The height of both subtrees cannot differ by more than one level.
* All leaf nodes are at the same depth (i.e., the tree is balanced).

In summary, multiple rotations in an AVL tree are required when there are imbalances between the left and right subtrees, specifically when the height difference exceeds one level."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
