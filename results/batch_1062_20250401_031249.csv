I don't know. The provided context appears to discuss various topics such as data structures, searching algorithms, and data efficiency, but it doesn't mention AVL trees or their specific requirements for rotation. Therefore, I cannot provide a relevant answer to your query about imbalances in an AVL tree requiring multiple rotations. If you have any additional context or information related to the topic, I'll be happy to help!|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"I can help you with that!

Based on the provided context, I don't have any direct information about AVL trees or their balancing mechanisms. However, since you're interested in learning more about data structures and search algorithms, I can provide some general insights.

AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees, which means they maintain a balance between the heights of the left and right subtrees at each node. This is done to ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

In an AVL tree, there are two types of imbalances that require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-heavy imbalance**: When the left subtree has more nodes than the right subtree.
2. **Right-heavy imbalance**: When the right subtree has more nodes than the left subtree.

To balance these imbalances, AVL trees use a combination of single and double rotations to restore the balance property. Single rotations involve rotating a single node, while double rotations involve rotating two nodes.

Here's a simplified overview of the rotation types:

* **Left-left (LL) rotation**: Rotates the root node to the left.
* **Right-right (RR) rotation**: Rotates the root node to the right.
* **Left-right (LR) rotation**: Rotates the left child and its right sibling.
* **Right-left (RL) rotation**: Rotates the right child and its left sibling.

When an imbalance is detected, the AVL tree performs a sequence of rotations to restore balance. The specific sequence depends on the type of imbalance and the location of the nodes involved.

Keep in mind that this information is based on general knowledge about AVL trees, rather than direct context from your provided PDFs.
