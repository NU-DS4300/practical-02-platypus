Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine which data types Redis supports for values based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro"" section, it mentions that Redis Data Types have values of various types. It lists strings, lists (which are like arrays), sets (which are unique collections of items), sorted sets (which maintain order but can still have duplicates?), and hashes (which map keys to values). There's also a mention of geospatial data with similarity, which I think is more related to another technology.

Next, in the ""Redis + Python"" sections on pages 4, 5, and 12, it talks about commands that involve mset and mget. It uses an example where Redis object 'key1' maps to 'val1', 'key2' to 'val2', and so on. Then, when you call mget with multiple keys, it returns a list of values in the order they were accessed. This indicates that mget can handle multiple keys by returning them as a list.

In page 5, there's an example where Redis object 'clickCount:/abc' is set to 0 and then incrementally incremented. When you call mget on 'clickCount:/abc', it returns the current value. The output shows ""click count = {ret_val}"", which suggests that mget can fetch values for a key, even if they are stored in the Redis object.

Putting this together, it seems like Redis supports strings as primary values, lists (arrays), sets (which include duplicates but maintain order?), sorted sets, and hashes. The commands provided also show that mset allows storing items with keys, and mget can retrieve these stored values either from individual keys or in a list format.

I should make sure to mention all these data types clearly and note any nuances like the difference between lists and sets, where sets allow duplicates but still maintain order.

Redis supports several primary data types for values. These include:

1. **Strings**: Used as the basic data type for storage.
2. **Sets**: Allow storing unique items while maintaining insertion order.
3. **Lists (Arrays)**: Store multiple elements in a sequence.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain their order of insertion.
5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Map keys to values using key-value pairs.

Additionally, Redis allows for the creation and storage of lists containing any binary sequences or strings. Commands like mset and mget demonstrate the ability to retrieve these values either by key or as a list.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for their values. Let me start by reading through the context provided.

First, I see that in the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" document, they mention that Redis Data Types have keys like strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (unique unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes (strings to strings), and geospatial data. That's a lot of types. They also mentioned that when using Redis with Python, there are specific commands for these operations.

Next, in another section of the same document, they talk about the Redis client object being called 'r'. They show an example where they use 'r.set' to set values and 'r.get' to retrieve them. Then, using 'r.mset' as a way to populate a collection with multiple key-value pairs. So that reinforces that Redis can handle lists.

Looking at other sections in the document about Redis interactions—like direct commands for setting and getting k/v pairs—they also mention variations like mget, lrange, and rpush. These all indicate different ways to manipulate data structures but don't introduce any new data types beyond strings or collections within sets.

In another part of the document from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", they classify Redis as a KV store but note that it can also be used in other models like graph, spatial, etc. This shows that while it's primarily a KV store, it can handle more complex data structures when needed.

So putting this all together, the primary data types supported are strings, lists (which include linked lists), sets, sorted sets, hashes. The document doesn't mention any other data types beyond what's covered in these sections, and all commands like mset, lrange, etc., are using these specific data structures.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

1. **Strings**: Used as keys or values in various operations.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Collections of unique string elements that can be accessed by position.
3. **Sets**: Unique string elements in a collection, which are unsorted and cannot have duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain an order based on insertion time.
5. **Hashes (Dictionary or Map)**: Mappings from keys to values using strings as key-value pairs.

These data types are widely supported and can be manipulated using Redis commands such as `rpush`, `rset`, `rlrange`, and others."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports as values based on the provided context. Let me go through each section carefully.

First, in the NoSQL introduction part (page 19), it mentions that Redis Data Types can be strings or binary sequences. So, I think that's two main types: Strings and Binary Sequences. But wait, is there more to it? The context says Values include Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, etc., but those are related to the data types themselves, not just their values.

Looking at the Redis in DS/ML section (page 14), it says Redis provides 16 databases by default. It also mentions its role as an in-memory database system with durability features like saving snapshots and journaling changes for roll-forward. So maybe there are other data types used with Redis, not just values stored in a Redis set.

In the NoSQL introduction (page 22), it lists Redis as a KV store, which is Key-Value storage. But I'm interested in the values themselves, so strings and binary sequences come up. Also, when reading about the database section (page 15), it mentions that Redis stores data in sets of key-value pairs, but it's primarily used for KVs.

I don't see anything about other data types like integers or dates mentioned. The more detailed sections on Python might cover commands, but they focus on string and command-specific functions like mset, hgetall, etc., not values per se.

So, putting this together: Redis as a KV store stores key-value pairs, where the value can be strings or binary sequences (like JSON objects). There are other data types used with Redis, such as numbers or dates, but they're managed internally through commands. The primary support for values is in these key-value pairs.
</think>

Redis supports multiple data types primarily stored within its key-value stores, though it focuses on strings and binary sequences due to its implementation. Here’s a structured breakdown:

1. **Key-Value Storage**: Redis uses key-value pairs (KVs), where each value can be:
   - **Strings** or
   - **Binary Sequences**

2. **Other Data Types**:
   - **Numbers**: Redis manages numbers internally through commands like `mset` for setting and `hgetall` for retrieving.
   - **Dates**: These are treated as strings by Redis, but parsed to dates when stored in key-value pairs.

3. **Data Structures**: While Redis is primarily a KV store, it can support other data models such as graphs or vectors through specific commands (e.g., `hset`, `mset`).

Thus, Redis's primary value storage uses strings and binary sequences, but it handles numbers and dates internally using commands designed for key-value operations."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
