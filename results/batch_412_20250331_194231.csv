Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. The user gave me a bunch of context files from a PDF about Neo4j and graph databases. Let me go through each one to see if any mention the invention date.

First, looking at ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011"". That seems specific. The page says it was created in 2011. So that's a date I can note.

Then there are three other ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 1, chunk Neo4j - A Graph Database System...) and two others at the same file on page 3. In both cases, it mentions that Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data, is relatively new, supports various indexes, ACID compliant, and distributed computing. The last part says ""created in 2011.""

Another PDF from ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 20, chunk Neo4j..."" mentions it's similar to Microsoft CosmoDB or Amazon Neptune, with similarity scores. It doesn't directly talk about when Neo4j was invented.

Then there's a Docker Compose section that talks about Neo4j in Docker Compose 4, but again, not relevant here unless the version is from 2011. But the query seems to be about the invention date.

The last file mentions Graph Algorithms - Practical Examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j by Needham and Hodler, with a similarity score of 0.49. It doesn't specify when Neo4j was created.

So all the context files point back to 2011. The most specific information is the first one that clearly states it's created in 2011. All other mentions are either about similar systems or not directly about the query language itself, except for parts of the same document mentioning the creation date. Therefore, I can confidently say that Neo4j's graph query language was invented in 2011.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me look through the context provided and see if any of the documents mention this specifically.

Starting with ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - A Graph Database System that supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data..."", it says Neo4j is a graph database system. The page mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011.

Then I check other documents to see if they provide more details about when Neo4j was introduced or when its query language was developed. 

In ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"", it talks about the introduction of a graph data model and mentions that Neo4j supports various types of indexing and is ACID compliant, which are important aspects for databases.

Another document refers to ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 5, chunk creating relationships with CREATE (...)"". It shows how edges are created in Neo4j, indicating the use of a graph query language because it supports directed relationships like Alice -> Bob.

There's also a Docker Compose section where they mention ports and environment variables for Neo4j. This suggests that Neo4j has been around longer, with its own development phases over several years.

Looking at ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 9, chunk Neo4j Browser 10 https://neo4j.com/docs/browser-manual/current/visual-tour/ localhost:7474)"", it's mentioned that Neo4j is a browser-based tool developed in 2022. This might mean that the latest version or updates were introduced around that time.

The ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" section doesn't specifically address Neo4j, but it gives context about NoSQL databases and their history, which might have influenced how graph databases like Neo4j are developed.

Putting this all together, Neo4j was created in 2011. The query language features include creating relationships with specific methods, showing that Neo4j supports these operations. The introduction of the graph data model and its compliance with ACID standards indicate a robust system for processing graphs.

Neo4j's graph query language was invented in **2011** when it was first introduced. It supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data, allows for creating relationships with directed edges, and is known for its ACID compliance and efficient algorithms."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me see... I remember that Neo4j is a graph database system that uses Cypher for querying data. The context provided has several documents and files about Neo4j.

Looking at the context, I see mentions like ""Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011."" That sounds pretty specific. It says it was developed around 2011. There's also a mention of an ACID compliant database, which is a characteristic of databases that support graph queries.

I don't see any references to when Cypher itself was invented or its original development date. The documents talk about Neo4j as the product but not much on Cypher specifics before 2011. So, it seems like the introduction and creation dates for Cypher are around 2011.
