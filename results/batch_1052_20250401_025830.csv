Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The user gave several documents discussing Neo4J.

The first document is from page 2 of ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"". It mentions that Neo4J was created in 2011 with Cypher, which is a graph query language. So that's a key point right there: Neo4J was introduced in 2011 with Cypher.

The second document, from page 1 of ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"", talks about the general introduction to Neo4J as a new no-sql database system. It says it supports both transactional and analytical processing. But that doesn't directly answer when Cypher was created. It just explains what Neo4J is.

The third document from ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" also discusses the introduction of Neo4J, mentioning it as a relatively new class of no-sql DBs. This again doesn't specify when Cypher was introduced but confirms that Neo4J supports graph-based data processing.

Looking at the other documents: from ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" on pages 20 and 1, there are mentions of graph algorithms in Apache Spark and Neo4j. The document from page 0 doesn't provide specific dates but references some materials from Northeastern University.

Putting this together, the most direct information is that Neo4J was created in 2011 with Cypher. All other documents either describe similar systems or data model aspects, which don't provide details on the introduction of the query language itself.

Alright, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by reading through the context provided.

The context lists several PDFs about Neo4j and related topics. The first one talks about Neo4j as a graph database system that supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data. It mentions things like ACID compliance, distributed computing, and specific procedures or plugins for graph data science.

Looking at the parts I'm interested in: From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher). The title says it's about how Neo4j creates a language for querying graphs. It also mentions that nodes are connected with relationships like (:User {name: ""Alice"", birthPlace: ""Paris""}) and CREATE (:User ... {since: ""2022-12-01""}]->(bob) 12. Relationships are directed.

The next part, From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 2, chunk What is a Graph Database), mentions that Neo4j's query language allows for querying nodes and relationships, and that in the example, it uses ""Since: [date]"" as an edge condition. This seems to be the key point.

So, in both contexts, Neo4j's Cypher syntax includes creating edges with conditions like since: a date. Therefore, the graph query language was invented by Neo4j.
</think>

Neo4j's graph query language was invented based on the context provided. It uses Cypher syntax to create relationships between nodes, including specifying edge conditions such as ""Since: [date]"". This indicates that Neo4j's query language allows for conditional edges in its graph database system.

Answer: When neo4j's graph query language was invented is based on its use of Cypher syntax to create directed edges with specific conditions like ""since: date"", which specifies the relationship's creation time."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

From the first paragraph of ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4jâ€™s graph query language created in 2011)"", it says that Neo4j was created in 2011. That seems like a good starting point.

Next, there are several other files and documents provided, but they all talk about Neo4j's features, similar systems, data models, introduction to graphs, how to import data into Neo4j, and so on. They mention the graph query language being part of Neo4j in various contexts, like using Cypher for querying.

Looking through them, I don't see any references to when Cypher was invented or the history of graph databases before Neo4j's creation. The documents talk about similar systems and data models but not about the development timeline of Neo4j itself.

Therefore, the most accurate information available is that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011. There's no indication from the context provided that Neo4j or its Cypher had a different origin date.
