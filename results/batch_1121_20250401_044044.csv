Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me go through each chunk one by one to see if any mention the number of Redis databases.

First, looking at the first chunk from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22), it says that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That seems clear. So, I can note down that Redis supports 16 databases.

The second chunk is also from the same document on page 17. It mentions Redis is an open-source in-memory database and sometimes referred to as a data structure store. It talks about KV stores but also notes it can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc., but that's more about how Redis can be integrated with different types of databases.

Next, the third chunk from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12) refers to Redis in context 13. It doesn't mention the number of databases here; it focuses on using Redis with Python and some examples related to feature stores.

The fourth chunk is from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 13), where Redis is discussed in ML â€“ a simplified example. Again, no numbers mentioned here either. The fifth part further explains Redis in DS/ML 15, which again doesn't mention the number of databases but talks about feature stores and ML contexts.

Throughout all these chunks, the key point that stands out is in the first chunk where it explicitly states that Redis provides 16 default databases. That seems to be the primary information I need for answering the query.

I don't see any other mentions of the number of databases here, so I can confidently say Redis supports 16 databases by default.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through each chunk of information step by step.

First, looking at the context from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 22 and 17, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So that's a key point here. The database numbers go from 0 to 15, which suggests there are 16 distinct databases. I don't see any other details about different names or variations mentioned in these chunks, so it seems like the main point is the count.

Next, the same document talks about Redis being an open-source, in-memory database system. It gives a list of supported features and uses cases, but that doesn't directly answer the number of databases. However, from what I gather earlier, there are 16 standard Redis databases.

I also notice another chunk from ""Redis + Python.pdf"" page 12 where it mentions Redis is considered an in-memory database system with specific durability features. It supports various data types like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. But again, that's more about what Redis can do rather than the number of databases it supports.

There are other references to Redis being maintained by the Redis Company and having a GitHub repository for documentation. However, these don't add any new information about the number of supported databases but confirm Redis as an established provider.

Looking back at all the chunks, the most relevant part is the one from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" where it clearly states that there are 16 databases by default. Since this document seems to be a common reference for Redis basics, I can trust that the count of 16 is accurate.

I also checked other parts like the features and sources linked in the context. The ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" doesn't provide any numbers except the database range, so it's safe to stick with that information. 

In conclusion, based on the provided context, Redis supports a total of 16 databases.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant section step by step.

First, looking at the NoSQL Intro document, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases. Each is numbered from 0 to 15. That's a clear number here. So I know Redis has 16 primary databases set up by default.

Then there's a section about Redis in DS/ML. It refers to the Redis database as ""db"" with an example using MadWithML, which might indicate that Redis is used within a specific application or system. However, this doesn't add new information beyond what's already stated.

The other sections like Python examples and Docker setup don't seem relevant to counting the number of databases Redis supports. They talk about functions, data types, and connection details but aren't providing any numbers related to database count.

So putting it all together, from the NoSQL Intro document, I can confidently say that Redis supports 16 default databases.

Redis supports 16 default databases as specified in its documentation.
