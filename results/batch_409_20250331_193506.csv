Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through each relevant section carefully.

First, there's a document from page 22, which is a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf."" In this file, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered 0 to 15. So that's an explicit number here.

Then, moving on to another PDF at page 18, the same title, there's more information about Redis as a database system. It says Redis is considered an in-memory system and supports durability through snapshots or journaling. However, it only handles lookup by key without support for complex data models like graphs, time series, etc.

Another document comes from page 17 titled ""Redis DB."" It describes Redis as a KV store that can also be used with other models but emphasizes its primary function as a KV store. This reinforces the idea that Redis is primarily a database supporting up to 16 databases in default.

The next document is from page 20, which provides details about Redis-py, the Python client for Redis. It mentions Redis is maintained by the company and lists some GitHub repositories and an environment setup on Conda.

Looking back at the query, it's asking specifically how many databases Redis supports. In the first PDF, the number is clearly stated as 16. Even though there are other sections that discuss Redis as a data model, they don't change the fact that the default number of supported databases is provided in this context.

So putting it all together, Redis supports 16 databases by default.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the query again: ""How many databases does Redis support?"" and then see what the context has to say about this.

Looking at the context, it seems like there are multiple files with various chunks that discuss Redis in different contexts. The first file is from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, which mentions Redis as a default database, but I don't see an explicit number here. It talks about 16 databases by default and some other aspects of Redis.

The second file is the same document (page 23) again about Redis supporting in-memory systems with specific operations like setting k/v pairs. That doesn't mention the number of databases.

Moving on to page 18, it's a different section from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf. It says Redis is an in-memory database but supports durability featuresâ€”either saving snapshots or appending-only files that can be rolled forward if something fails. This also doesn't give the number of databases.

The third file is 06 - Redis + Python.pdf, which starts talking about connecting to Redis through Docker and Python. It mentions Redis-py as a client for Python but again, no specific information on the number of supported databases.

Page 11 has some examples with Redis Pipelines, showing how it handles multiple calls without issues, but that's more about functionality than database support count.

The next page is from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 13), which discusses Redis in machine learning. It provides an example using r.set and other commands, again focusing on functionality rather than the number of databases.

On page 4, there's a simple Redis example with set and increment operations, but no mention of the database count. The hash command example doesn't give a specific database either.

Finally, page 9 in the same document (06 - Redis + Python.pdf) has a hset and hgetall example, again operating on individual databases without a number provided.

So, going through all these files, none of them explicitly mention how many databases Redis supports. They talk about it as an in-memory database or discussing its use with other models like graphs, text search, etc., but not the total number supported.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me start by reading through each paragraph carefully.

First, in page 22 of the NoSQL Intro document, it says Redis provides 16 databases by default and they're numbered from 0 to 15. It mentions there's no other name associated with them, so that part is straightforward. So, that's 16 databases right there.

Looking at the following paragraph on Redis DB, it mentions Redis DB is an in-memory database system primarily used as a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. It doesn't talk about specific databases except for stating they're in-memory and primary focus on KV interactions.

In the next part, from page 6 of the same NoSQL intro document, it explains that Redis is open-source and supports various data structures:KV, graphs, spatial, vector, time series, and other models. So that means Redis isn't just for KVs but has broader support beyond that.

Then, there's a section on Redis Pipelines where they show how to chain commands without multiple calls, which is about efficiency in network usage. They mention the Redis client setup using host, port, and database numbers. I don't see any information here about the number of databases directly related to this part.

The following paragraph from the Python document (page 9) uses a Redis client with hset, hgetall commands but doesn't specify the number of supported databases. It just shows examples of string commands in Redis.

Another paragraph on page 13 is about simplifying the example for ML using Redis Data Types and Values, which again mentions strings, lists, sets, etc., but no mention of the database count.

Page 20 discusses Redis data types including keys, values as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (strings to string), and geospatial data. This tells us about the structure of data in Redis, not the number of databases it supports.

So compiling all this information: The first paragraph clearly states that Redis provides 16 databases numbered from 0 to 15. All other paragraphs mention aspects related to Redis being an in-memory system or supporting various models but don't provide specific numbers about the database count.
</think>

The context indicates that Redis supports a total of 16 databases, which are identified as numbered from 0 to 15.
