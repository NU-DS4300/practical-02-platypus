Alright, I need to figure out whenNeo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me look through the context provided.

First, in page 2 of ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf,"" it says Neo4j created its graph query language in 2011. So that's a clear date here. 

I don't see any other references toNeo4j or its history. The other pages discuss the system and related technologies but don't add more information on the origin of Neo4j itself.

Therefore, I can confidently say that Neo4j's graph query language was invented in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me look through the context provided. 

First, I see a paragraph from ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011..."". It mentions that Neo4j was created by a company in 2011. That gives me an initial thought—the answer might be around 2011.

Then, there's another part from ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 1, chunk What is a Graph Database..."". This doesn't directly mention Neo4j but talks about the graph model, mentioning ACID compliance and similar systems. It also compares it to Microsoft CosmoDB and Amazon Neptune with similarity scores of 0.21 each.

There's another section from ""From 07 - Document DBs and Mongo.pdf (page 9, chunk MongoDB..."". This mentions MongoDB as a document-based database service released in 2016. So MongoDB is the product that was introduced then, but it's not directly about Neo4j's query language.

Looking at the other documents, they discuss similar systems like Spark and CosmoDB but again don't mention Neo4j specifically.

So putting this together: Neo4j was created in 2011 as a graph database system. The rest of the context talks about other graph databases (like CosmoDB, MongoDB) and their similarities, which support the idea that Neo4j's query language is mentioned in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language was invented in 2011.

Alright, so the user is asking about when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. I remember that Neo4j is a graph database, and I think it uses something called Cypher for querying data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall what Cypher is. From my previous knowledge, Cypher is a query language specifically designed for graph databases like Neo4j. It's not standard SQL or any other programming language that I can think of off the top of my head. So, it must have been invented as a separate language to handle the unique aspects of graph data.

Now, thinking about when things in software development happen, Cypher was probably introduced somewhere around 2011. There's a paper or a document where they discuss how Neo4j is created and its query language. The user provided a link that mentions Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - ... (from 2011). That sounds like the year when Cypher was first introduced.

Wait, I should double-check if there's any other language or technology that handles graph queries before Cypher came out. But I don't recall anything like this before 2011. It makes sense because graph databases are a newer thing compared to relational databases which have their own query languages like SQL. So, Cypher was definitely the first for Neo4j.

I also remember that Neo4j started in 2011, and it's part of the Mongoose project. Mongoose is a NoSQL database, so I think Cypher would be a key component there to handle graph data efficiently.

So, putting this all together, when Neo4j's graph query language, which is Cypher, was invented? It must have been in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as **Cypher**, was invented around **2011**. This was the introduction of Cypher into the system that led to Neo4j's development.
