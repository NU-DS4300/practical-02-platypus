"I don't know.

The provided context appears to be about database systems, replication, and consistency, rather than AVL trees or rotation algorithms. The queries seem to be related to database design and scalability, rather than data structures like AVL trees. Therefore, I'm unable to provide an accurate answer based on the given context. If you have a different query or provide more relevant information, I'll do my best to assist you."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to databases, data replication, and graph data models, but it doesn't seem to have any information about AVL trees or rotation requirements. The query is specifically asking about AVL trees, which seems to be outside the scope of the given context."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The provided context does not seem to be relevant to the query about AVL trees or their rotations. The documents appear to be discussing topics such as relational databases, data replication, and graph data models, but none of these topics are directly related to AVL trees or their imbalances.|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
