I don't know. The context provided is about data replication and monotonic read consistency, which seems unrelated to AVL trees or their imbalances. Therefore, I'm unable to answer the query accurately. If you could provide more context or clarify the relationship between the two topics, I'd be happy to help!|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The context provided is about data replication and monotonic read consistency, which has no relation to AVL trees or their balancing mechanisms. The query is asking about a specific topic in computer science (AVL tree imbalances), but it's not relevant to the given context.|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
