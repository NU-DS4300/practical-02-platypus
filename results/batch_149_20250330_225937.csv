Okay, let's break this down step by step. The user is asking about Redis data types for values and wants the list named ""data types supported."" I need to use the provided context to answer accurately.

First, looking at the context, it mentions that Redis supports several binary sequence types. The key points are: strings, lists (linked lists), sets (which are unique unsorted), sorted sets, hashes which return a string result, and geospatial data with specific similarity values.

I should list each type clearly, making sure to mention their definitions as they appear in the context. It's important to be concise but complete since the query is straightforward. I'll make sure each data type is correctly associated with its kind of value from the provided context.

Wait, in the answer, it seems like there was a mention of ""sets"" and ""sorted sets,"" so I need to include both. Also, the hashes have similarity numbers which might be relevant if the user wants that information too, but since the query is about naming, perhaps those details aren't needed unless specified.

I should ensure that all data types from the context are included without adding extra info beyond what's provided. So, I'll list each type with its corresponding value kind as per the context.

The Redis data types for values include:

- Strings (usually strings but can be any binary sequence)
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets
- Hashes (string → string)
- Geospatial data (with similarity values 0.17)"|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to this query about Redis data types for values based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.

The context mentions that Redis supports several data types for storing and retrieving information. It lists Values with examples like strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (unsorted string elements), sorted sets, and hashes which map keys to values. I should make sure each of these is correctly noted in my answer.

Wait, hold on—there's a mention of ""values"" and then later ""Values"". That might be a typo because ""values"" usually refer to what you store, not the type itself. So maybe it's supposed to say ""Values (what you store)"" instead of ""Values (what you store)"". I should correct that in my answer.

Also, looking at the data types provided: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes with a note about geospatial data and similarity. I need to include all these as per the query.

So putting it together, the answer should list each of these data types clearly, using ""Values"" correctly after their respective names. The mention of geospatial data might be extra unless the query specifically asks for that, but since it's included in the context, I'll include it as well to show a broader scope.

I also need to ensure that my answer is concise and doesn't repeat information unnecessarily. Since ""Values"" was mentioned twice (once as ""Values"" and then again under Geospatial data), I should clarify that this was an example and not a mistake.

Alright, let me structure the answer: list each data type with its name and what it stores. Make sure to correct the typo and include all listed types.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- **Strings**: store text or numeric strings
- **Lists**: store unsorted linked lists of items
- **Sets**: store unique, unsorted string elements (no duplicates)
- **Sorted Sets**: store sorted sets of unique string elements
- **Hashes**: store key-value pairs where keys are mapped to values using a binary tree structure

Note: ""Values"" refers to the data types themselves, and while geospatial data was mentioned as an example, it's not part of the query."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer this query about Redis' value data types based on the provided context. The user has given me a snippet from a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" which includes information about Redis Data Types, Keys, and their values.

First, let's look at the query: ""Name the data types supported by Redis for values."" I need to identify each value mentioned in the context related to data types. The context lists several key points:

- Values include strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which can be unique or unsorted string elements), sorted sets, and hashes (which map from strings to other strings). There's also a mention of geospatial data with similarity metrics.

Wait, the query is specifically asking about values, so I should focus on that. Redis Data Types includes keys as well, but since the context mentions ""Values,"" it seems they are referring to the different types of data stored in Redis databases.

So, putting it together, the values supported by Redis for storing data include:
- Strings
- Lists (which are like arrays)
- Sets (can be unique or not)
- Sorted Sets
- Hashes

The context also includes a note about geospatial data with similarity metrics, but that's more of an example and probably not directly relevant to the query.

I should make sure I'm only naming the types, so strings are one category. Then lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes are separate categories. Geospatial data is mentioned in another context or perhaps as an additional point, but it's not part of this specific data types list.

So my answer should mention each of these value types clearly.
