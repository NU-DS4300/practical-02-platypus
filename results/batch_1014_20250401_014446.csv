I don't know. The provided context is about chunk and specialVal, data structures, and search efficiency, but it doesn't mention AVL trees or their imbalances. Therefore, I'm unable to provide an accurate answer based on the given context. If you're looking for information on AVL tree imbalances and rotations, I'd be happy to help if you provide more relevant context!|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant. 
Use the following context to answer the query as accurately as possible. If the context is 
not relevant to the query, say 'I don't know'."|What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?
"Based on the provided context, I don't have any information about AVL trees or their imbalances. The context appears to be discussing data structures and searching algorithms, but it doesn't mention AVL trees specifically.

Therefore, my answer is: I don't know."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"Based on the provided context, I don't have any information about AVL trees or their imbalances that would indicate whether multiple rotations are required or not. The context appears to be unrelated to the query.

Therefore, my answer is:

I don't know."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
