Okay, so the user asked when Redis was released. I remember that Redis is an open-source in-memory database system. From the context provided, especially pages 18 and 19 of the PDFs, it mentions that Redis was developed in C++ but then moved to Python later. The main release date mentioned there is 2009 when it started developing in C++. 

I should confirm this, as I think I remember Redis being one of the earliest in-memory databases. They were indeed working on it from around 2005 or 2006 before moving to Python. Also, since they mention it's open-source and primarily used for KV stores but can be extended, that gives me more context about why they moved away from C++ towards a modern language.

I'll make sure to mention both the original release and their transition back to Python without major changes. That way, I cover all bases as per the provided text.

Redis was initially developed in 2005 or earlier as part of a larger project but was later moved to Python. The primary release date is 2009 when it began development.

Answer: Redis was first released in 2009."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo. You are also an expert in AWS as a service.

Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me look at the context provided. There are several sections about Redis in different files and chunks.

First, there's a part from page 18 of ""NoSQL Intro"" where it says Redis is an in-memory database system that supports durability features like snapshots and journaling for roll-forward. It mentions it was developed by Redis Company in 2009 but can be very fast with over 100,000 set operations per second.

Then, looking at the other files: ""Redis + Python.pdf"" discusses Redis as a Python client, which suggests it's an open-source product. The section about its ranking in KV stores mentions Redis is number 18. It also says Redis has libraries like redis and pyre, which are mentioned on pages 20-23.

In the Docker section from ""NoSQL Intro"", it talks about setting up Redis in Docker but doesn't mention a specific release date. However, since Redis was developed in 2009 and is still widely used, I think that's when it was released.

The other sections like Redis-py being on Conda Environment and the source for ML (mlops) course also don't provide release dates beyond the general information about being an open-source product.

So putting this together, Redis was developed in 2009 by the Redis Company. Even though Redis-py is a Python client, the core Redis system itself was released that year.

Redis was developed and introduced by Redis Company in 2009. It remains one of the most widely used open-source in-memory database systems today.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. From the context provided, there are several documents about Redis. The first one is from page 18 of ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf."" It says that Redis was developed in 2009 by C++ and originally came out as a server on Amazon Web Services (AWS). That makes sense because I know AWS has been around for a long time.

The next document is about ""Redis + Python.pdf"" from page 12, which mentions that Redis was maintained by the Redis Company. So that would mean Redis started in 2009 when it first came out on AWS as well.

Then there are other documents like ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22)"" and several others from pages 4 and 14, which talk about Redis being used in various waysâ€”like as a KV store, DS/ML, pipelines, and more. These documents all seem to corroborate the information that Redis was released by the company in 2009.

I don't see any mention of Redis being released before 2009 or after 2015 in this context. So it seems consistent across all provided materials that Redis was first released in 2009, on Amazon Web Services.

Redis was released by the company on Amazon Web Services in 2009.
