Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j. From the context provided, Neo4j is a graph database that supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data. It has a Cypher query language built into it, which allows users to perform complex queries on their data.

Looking at the documents linked, there's a section on page 2 from ""Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011."" That seems like a key point here because it mentions that Cypher was created in 2011. So, if that's the version where Cypher was introduced, then Neo4j's graph query language would have been invented around that time.

I should make sure there are no other versions of Cypher or related tools from Neo4j mentioned in the context provided. The document does mention Neo4j itself but doesn't refer to any subsequent versions beyond 2011. So, it seems safe to conclude that Cypher was introduced in 2011.

Additionally, the introduction part talks about Neo4j being a graph database and mentioning that it has Cypher as its query language built into it, which directly supports the idea of an invented version where this language comes into play.

I don't see any conflicting information or other versions mentioned, so I think it's safe to say that Cypher was introduced in 2011, which is when Neo4j's graph query language was created.

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented around the year 2011. This introduction marked a significant milestone as it became a core component of the Neo4j database system, enabling users to perform complex queries on graph-based data.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me go through the context provided step by step.

First, there's a section about Neo4j's Cypher query language from page 2 of ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher"". It says that Neo4j was created in 2011 with the goal of providing a graph query language. That seems important. The context also mentions other databases like NoSQL, which were around from the 90s and 2000s.

Then, there's another section from ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" on page 15 that says Neo4j supports distributed computing, similar to Microsoft CosmoDB or Amazon Neptune. The similarity score here is 0.35, which isn't as high as the other sections.

There are notes about various topics like ACID compliance and indexing, but those don't directly relate to when Cypher was invented.

Looking at the query provided: ""When was neo4j's graph query language invented?"" The answer from the context is that Neo4j was created in 2011 with the goal of providing a graph query language. That seems clear and matches the information given.

I don't see any conflicting or irrelevant information, so I can confidently say that the answer is 2011.
</think>

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented in 2011 with the primary goal of providing a graph query language. This makes the context accurate and relevant to the question.

**Answer:** Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented in 2011."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, I can see several documents and pages discussing Neo4j, which is a NoSQL database system. One of them is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011)."", which mentions that Cypher was created in 2011 as a visual way to match patterns and relationships. Another document is ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 20, chunk A Graph Database System..."", which talks about the graph data model but doesn't specify the exact year it was invented.

Looking at the Cypher section in page 2, it says Cypher was created in 2011. That seems like a clear indication that Neo4j's graph query language was introduced around that time. The other document is more about the overall NoSQL system and its applications, so while related to graphs, it doesn't directly address when Cypher was invented.

Therefore, I can conclude that Neo4j's graph query language, which includes Cypher, was invented in 2011.
