"A query that's right up my alley!

According to the context, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

These are the value data types mentioned in the Redis documentation and tutorials provided in the context."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"A query about Redis!

According to the provided context, Redis supports the following data types for values:

1. **Strings**: A sequence of characters that can be any binary sequence.
2. **Lists** (linked lists): An ordered collection of strings.
3. **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements): An unordered collection of unique strings.
4. **Sorted Sets**: An ordered collection of strings with a score associated with each element.
5. **Hashes** (string → string): A dictionary-like data structure that maps strings to other strings.

These are the primary value data types supported by Redis, as mentioned in the context."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
