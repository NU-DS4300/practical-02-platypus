Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, I see that there are two PDF sections. The first one is from page 2 of ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf,"" which talks about Neo4j as a graph database system. It mentions it supports both transactional and analytical processing, has various indexing options, is ACID compliant, and can handle distributed computing. There's also a mention of an APOC plugin mentioned in the same document.

The second PDF is from page 1 of ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf."" This seems to describe Neo4j as a graph database system that supports both types of processing, has optional schemas, and supports various indexing methods. It's also ACID compliant and can run on distributed systems.

In the query provided, it asks when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Looking at the context, I don't see any direct information about the history or origin of Neo4j itself. The PDF sections discuss its use as a database system but do not provide details on how it came about or when it was developed.

Therefore, without explicit information in the provided text, it's safe to conclude that the query is based on incomplete data regarding Neo4j's history.

Okay, so the user is asking about when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. I need to figure this out using the provided context.

First, looking at the context, there are a few documents mentioned. The first one is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" which has two chunks. The second chunk here is from page 2 of that document. It talks about Neo4j being created in 2011 as a graph query language. So that's definitely the answer.

Wait, but are there other documents that might mention this? The next one is ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" which has two chunks too. In those, they discuss similar topics like the data model and algorithms, but I don't see a direct reference here to Neo4j's graph query language.

The fourth document at ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" has another chunk from page 0, and it mentions that Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing. That doesn't directly answer the query about the invention date.

So the main source for the invented year is the first document where Neo4j was introduced in 2011. Other documents discuss other aspects of Neo4j but don't provide the exact year it was created.

The graph query language in Neo4j was invented in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The user gave me several PDF sections and some notes. 

Looking at the first part, there are two PDFs about Neo4j. The second one is from 2011 and talks about the creation of Cypher in 2011. It mentions that the goal was to create a graph query language for graph databases. So, since Cypher was created in 2011, that might be the year when Neo4J's graph query language was invented.

I should make sure there are no other information in the context conflicting with this. The introduction mentions that Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing, which is a characteristic of its graph-based data model. It also notes that it's a relatively new class of No-SQL databases and considers schema optional. These features were probably influenced by earlier languages or systems that dealt with graph queries.

The other parts like the Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf mention similar aspects, but they don't provide any specific years beyond what's in the Cypher document. The note from Northeastern University about graph algorithms and practices in Apache Spark and Neo4j also might not add extra information on when Neo4J was created, as that seems to be more about its implementation with other languages.

Additionally, the query provided is about when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Since the document explicitly states that Cypher, which handles graphs, was created in 2011, I can confidently say that Neo4J's graph query language was invented around 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was introduced in 2011.
