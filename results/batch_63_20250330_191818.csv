"Based on the provided context, I can answer that the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages an instance goes through during its lifespan. According to page 4 of the document, these stages are:

1. Launch - starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. Start/Stop - temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. Terminate - permanently deleting the instance.
4. Reboot - restarting an instance without affecting data on the root volume.

These lifecycle events allow you to manage and control your EC2 instances as needed."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"According to the provided context from ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf (page 4, chunk EC2 Lifecycle"", the EC2 lifecycle consists of the following stages:

1. Launch - starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. Start/Stop - temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. Terminate - permanently deleting the instance.
4. Reboot - restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

I don't know if there's any additional information beyond this, but these four stages make up the EC2 lifecycle according to the provided context."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
