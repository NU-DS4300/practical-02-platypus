Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant part of the context.

First, in ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 18, chunk Redis)"", it mentions that Redis was originally developed in C++. It says Redis was first introduced in 2009. That's a key point.

Looking at the other documents:
- ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12, chunk Redis in Context 13)"" also states that Redis was introduced in 2009.
- In ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17, chunk Redis DB)"", it's again mentioned as being developed around the same time.
- The ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf"" page has a mention of Redis-py and that Redis is maintained by the company. It also says Redis was first introduced in 2009.

All these sources point to Redis being released in 2009, which seems consistent across different contexts and documents.

Alright, I need to figure out when Redis was first released. Let me look through the context provided and see if any of the entries mention its release date.

Starting from page 18 in NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, it says Redis is an open-source in-memory database system that originated from a C++ project. The original development dates back to 2009. That seems like a strong indication that Redis was released around 2009. There's no mention of any subsequent updates or changes in the context provided.

Looking through the other pages, I don't see any information about Redis's release date mentioned. All entries are related to Redis as an engine used in different contexts like databases, Python libraries, and ML frameworks, but nothing about its official release timeline.

Therefore, based on the available data, Redis was first released in 2009.

Redis was first released in 2009 when it started developing as a C++ project. The exact date isn't specified beyond the initial version year."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me go through each part of the query and see if it has anything related to Redis's release date.

First, looking at the context, there are several documents mentioned, all starting with ""Redis."" The first document is from page 18 of NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf. In that file, under section 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, it says ""Originally developed in 2009 in C++."" That sounds familiar; I think Redis was started in 2005 or earlier as a prototype, but the main development came later.

In another document from page 17 of the same NoSQL Intro chapter, under Redis DB section, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. This further supports the idea that Redis is an open-source database system created by the Redis Company in 2009.

The documents from the Python courses (05 and 06) don't talk about Redis's release date directly. They focus on how to work with Redis, using Python as a client. The section ""Setting Up Redis in Docker"" mentions adding ports, which is standard setup for a system, but it doesn't indicate when Redis was released.

Other sections like Hash Commands and String Commands are all part of the documentation provided to the user, which I assume includes how to use Redis, including its versioning mechanisms. Again, these don't mention Redis's release date.

So compiling this information, all the relevant documents point out that Redis was developed by the Redis Company in 2009 as a prototype and then expanded upon into a full-open-source database system. The other documents talk about how to set up Redis on different environments but don't specify its release year.

Redis was released in 2009 as part of its development as a prototype and later expanded into a full-open-source database system by the Redis Company.
