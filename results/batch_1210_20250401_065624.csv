"A question about my favorite in-memory database!

According to the context, I have multiple documents related to Redis and Python. While it's not directly mentioned in any of these documents, I can provide you with the information from a reliable source.

Redis was first released in 2005 by Salvatore Sanfilippo. It started as an open-source project, and since then, it has gained popularity as a NoSQL database for its speed, flexibility, and ease of use.

So, to answer your question: Redis was released in 2005."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo. You are also an expert in AWS as a service. 
    Use the following context to answer the query as accurately as possible. If the context is 
    not relevant to the query, say that, then answer to the best of your ability anyways."|When was Redis released?
