Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. The user provided a bunch of context documents and some queries from them. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, in the NoSQL Introduction document from page 22, it says that Redis provides 16 databases by default. They're numbered from 0 to 15. That's pretty clear, but I should make sure there aren't any other aspects mentioned here that might change the number or details of these databases.

Looking at the next section on Redis DB, it mentions Redis is an open-source in-memory database and a KV store by default. It doesn't say anything about having additional databases beyond the 16 it starts with. So I can probably ignore any details about extra storage solutions like Redis Server, which is for managing Redis instances.

Then there's another document from page 18 that talks about Redis being an in-memory database system supporting durability of data. It mentions snapshots and append-only files for roll-forward scenarios. There’s also a part about its speed—up to 100,000 SET operations per second—and it doesn’t mention anything about additional databases beyond the initial 16.

The next document is about Redis in Python, from page 19. It says Redis-py is the standard client for Python and is maintained by the Redis Company. The GitHub repository link and the conda environment setup are also provided, but again, nothing related to additional databases.

So putting it all together, Redis starts with 16 databases numbered 0 to 15. Even though there's information about other functionalities or tools like Redis Server for managing instances, those don't expand the count of supported databases. The documents discuss how Redis is used ( KV store), durability options, performance metrics, and integration into Python.

Therefore, I can confidently say that Redis supports exactly 16 databases.

Alright, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each chunk one by one.

First, in the NoSQL database section, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases numbered 0 to 15. So, that's a clear number here. 

Looking further down, there's a part about Redis being an in-memory data store with features like durability. It says they support durability through snapshots and append-only files. This might be important but not directly related to the count of supported databases.

In another section, it mentions Redis has a rich collection of commands that handle various operations, especially for KV stores. However, this doesn't specify the number of databases it supports, which is what I'm looking for.

I also see a specific document ""Redis Data Types Keys"" where it lists various data types like strings, lists, sets, etc., but again, this is about the data types and not the count of supported databases.

The next section talks about Redis being a client for Python, mentioning that it's in your 4300 Conda Environment and other setups. This isn't directly relevant to the number of databases Redis supports, unless ""Python"" refers to multiple libraries or something else, but I don't think so.

So, the only part that clearly states the count is the initial statement about 16 databases numbered 0-15. The rest are either about features or documentation without numbers.

From the context provided, Redis supports a total of 16 databases. These are numbered from 0 to 15 and are considered the default databases by the Redis framework.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through each section carefully.

Starting from page 22, they mention that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That's clear. So that's one number right there: 16.

Looking further down, on page 17, they talk about Redis as a data structure store and list several types like KV store, Graph, Spatial, etc., but I don't think those count towards the database support figure. The relevant part is at page 22 where it says ""direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs (and variations)."" That's about managing the storage itself, not the number of databases.

On pages 18-19, they detail Redis' in-memory capabilities. It mentions that Redis supports durability features like snapshots and append-only files. They also list various data types but again, that doesn't relate to counting databases.

Then on page 20, they talk about Redis Data Types, which include keys, values, sets, sorted sets, hashes, etc., but nothing about the number of databases. The key point here is just the different types of data storage.

On page 19, there's a section on Redis Command List with a full list, highlighting that it’s not exhaustive. However, since it's a documentation link, it doesn't directly answer the count of supported databases.

So, putting this together: Redis supports 16 databases in its default setup. The other sections are about how to use Redis for different purposes, its durability features, and data types within Redis, but none of those contribute to the number of databases.
</think>

Redis supports a total of 16 databases by default. These are referred to as ""0 to 15"" in the context provided. This information is contained in the section discussing direct interaction with Redis, specifically that it provides 16 databases by default.
