Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through the relevant sections step by step.

First, in the Redis Database and Interaction section of the PDF (page 22), it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. They are numbered from 0 to 15. So that's a clear number here: 16 databases. I should note that down as one of the main points.

Then, in the Redis DB section of page 17, it explains that Redis is an open-source, in-memory database system that primarily supports KV stores (Key-Value stores). It can be used with various models like graphs, spatial data, time series, etc. But when talking about the number of supported databases, I don't see any specific mention here.

Looking at the Docker section from page 05, it talks about how to connect to Redis via Docker, mentioning host and port configurations but doesn't address the number of databases directly there.

The Python section (page 06) introduces Redis-py as a client for Python. It also lists some libraries that work with Redis in Python but doesn’t specify the number of supported databases here either.

So, focusing solely on the context provided, the primary information about the number of Redis databases is given in page 22. The paragraph there explicitly states that Redis provides 16 default databases from 0 to 15. Therefore, the answer should be 16.

Redis supports a total of 16 default databases, numbered from 0 to 15.

Answer: Redis supports 16 default databases (numbers 0 to 15)."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by recalling the context provided. From the file ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22, chunk Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default)"", it mentions that Redis offers 16 databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15.

The other file ""Redis + Python.pdf"" gives more specific details about how Redis is integrated with Python. It talks about using Redis Pipelines, connecting to a Redis server, and executing commands like set, hset, lset, etc., but it doesn't mention any additional databases beyond the initial 16.

So, based on that, Redis primarily supports these 16 databases for in-memory operations. The other documents also support various data types and commands, but those are more about how to interact with Redis directly rather than listing the actual databases Redis itself provides.
</think>

Redis supports a total of **16 databases by default** as mentioned in the context. These databases can be accessed through Redis's server using their respective keys (0 to 15). The other documents discuss commands for connecting and manipulating data within these databases, but they do not include Redis in their list."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, it seems like there's a lot of information about Redis but not directly answering the question. Let me go through each section to find any mention of multiple database systems.

First, on page 22, it says Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That's straightforward—redis is supported in both relational and NoSQL contexts, but here it's focused on the NoSQL side with the 16 distinct databases.

Looking further, there are chunks discussing Redis as a database system in general, not just NoSQL. It mentions that Redis supports durability features like snapshots and journaling, which can be done via disk or file, and append-only files. So, it's more about the broader data model rather than specific database names.

Then, on page 17, it lists various data models Redis is versatile with: KV store, graph, spatial, text search, vector, time series. These are different data models within NoSQL but not individual databases.

In the Python section (page 06), it talks about using Redis in Python via the redis library. It mentions that Redis supports multiple database connections directly and through commands, which is more of a setup for how to use Redis with Python rather than specifying the number of databases Redis offers.

On page 13, there's an example showing a simplified Redis ML scenario, demonstrating operations but not mentioning specific database numbers.

So, putting it all together: Redis itself has 16 distinct databases (0-15). It's used in different data models like NoSQL and supports various commands for managing multiple connections. There are no other major database systems mentioned except for the NoSQL ones with their own counts.

Redis provides **16 distinct databases** by default, numbered from 0 to 15.
