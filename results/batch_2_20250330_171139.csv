Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the query about what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. The user has given a context from a PDF about data replication and anomalies related to monotonic reads, but I don't see any direct information on AVL trees or their imbalances.

First, I should recall what an AVL tree is. An AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which helps maintain efficient search and insertion times—O(log n) complexity instead of O(n) in unbalanced trees.

Imbalances in an AVL tree occur when a node's left and right subtree heights are not equal. If the right subtree is higher than the left or vice versa by more than one level, that's considered an imbalance. When such imbalances happen during operations like insertion or deletion, rotations are needed to rebalance the tree.

The query is asking specifically about imbalances requiring multiple rotations. In AVL trees, this typically occurs when the tree becomes two levels too imbalanced on one side after a node is inserted or deleted. For example, if inserting into a leaf causes the new node to have a right subtree that's two nodes higher than its left, you would perform a single rotation (right rotation) to rebalance it.

However, in the provided context about data replication and anomalies, there's mention of ""Monotonic read consistency Monotonic read anomalies,"" which refers to when older data is read after newer data. This doesn't relate directly to AVL tree imbalances. So, I don't think this context provides any information on AVL trees or their rebalancing mechanisms.

Since the query is about AVL trees and multiple rotations, but the provided context doesn't address this, my answer should state that I don't know based on the given context.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Hmm, let's start by recalling what an AVL tree is. It's a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This helps keep operations like insertion and deletion efficient because they take O(log n) time.

Now, the query is about imbalances that require multiple rotations to fix. I remember that an AVL tree is height balanced, so it inherently tries to balance itself during insertions or deletions. So why do we need multiple rotations?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with other balancing techniques. Let me think. In some cases, like when inserting a new node causes the subtree's height difference to exceed one, we only make one rotation. But what if that isn't enough? Maybe there are situations where you have more than two levels of imbalance.

Oh, right! I think it's called ""double rebalancing"" or something similar. When an insertion leads to three consecutive nodes where each has a subtree height difference greater than one, we might need multiple rotations to fix the structure. For example, if during insertion, after inserting a node, the root node's left and right children have heights that differ by more than one, we perform a rotation on both sides. That takes two operations.

Wait, but is it called double rebalance or something else? I think it's known as ""double rotation"" or ""double rotation operation."" So this means when an AVL tree has more severe imbalances, requiring more steps to balance.

I should also consider if there are any other common scenarios where multiple rotations might be needed. Oh yeah, another example is when a deletion causes the height of two nodes in the chain to exceed one. In such cases, a single rotation isn't enough, and you have to do two.

So putting it together, imbalances that require multiple rotations happen when there are three or more consecutive nodes where each has an imbalance in their subtree heights. This necessitates performing two rotations to restore balance.

I think I've got it now. The answer should be double rotation.

Alright, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees.

An AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which keeps operations like insertion, deletion, and search efficient, typically in O(log n) time complexity.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree occur when this property is violated, meaning the left subtree's height is two greater than the right or vice versa. The question is about how many rotations are needed to rebalance such a node.

I remember that for each imbalance, there can be one rotation required—either a single left rotation or a single right rotation to restore the balance. But I'm not entirely sure if both types of imbalances require just one rotation each. Let me think through some examples.

Imagine a scenario where the tree is unbalanced on the right side. In this case, we can perform a right rotation on the right child to bring it down closer to the root. Similarly, if the imbalance is on the left, a single left rotation would suffice. So, each type of imbalance seems to require just one rotation.

I should also consider whether multiple rotations are ever needed for an imbalance that isn't on a leaf node. I think in most cases, only one rotation is necessary because after correcting one side, the tree becomes balanced again. There's no need for additional steps if you fix one node at a time.

Wait, what about cases with more than two levels of imbalance? For example, maybe the left subtree has another level of imbalances. But I don't think that requires multiple rotations because each rotation is local to fixing the immediate imbalance. Once it's fixed, it doesn't affect other parts of the tree.

So, putting this together, any single-level imbalance in an AVL tree can be corrected with a single rotation. There's no case where more than one rotation is needed for an imbalance that only affects its own subtree.
</think>

In an AVL tree, each level of imbalance can be corrected using just one rotation—either a left or right rotation—to restore balance. Multiple rotations are not required because each imbalance is handled incrementally, ensuring efficient rebalancing without affecting other parts of the tree.

Answer: In an AVL tree, any single-level imbalance requires exactly one rotation to correct, either by rotating the affected node's child upwards (right if on the right side) or downwards (left if on the left side). Multiple rotations are not needed since each fix is local."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
