Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause it to require multiple rotations. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees. They're a type of self-balancing binary search tree where each node maintains two heights: one for the left subtree and one for the right subtree. The key point is that the heights of the two subtrees should never differ by more than one for an AVL tree to remain balanced.

So, imbalances in an AVL tree happen when this balance condition isn't met after a node insertion or deletion. That means if inserting a new node causes the left and right subtree heights to differ by two, it's unbalanced. How do we handle that? I remember something about rotation.

Rotations are used to rebalance the tree. There are different types of rotations, like single and double. A single rotation is when you need only one change in nodes, while a double rotation involves changing more than just one node. The question is asking specifically about imbalances that require multiple rotations, so I think it's related to double rotations.

Let me visualize this. Suppose I have an AVL tree where the root has two left children with equal heights. If I insert a new node in such a way that both subtrees end up higher than their respective heights by one, causing the balance condition to fail. To fix this, the tree can perform a right rotation on the right child of the root to bring it down into its left subtree. This should rebalance the tree.

Wait, but what if inserting a node causes two different nodes to shift? That would necessitate another rotation, hence a double rotation. So in such cases where more than one node needs to be moved up or down during insertion or deletion, multiple rotations are required.

I also remember that for every insertion or deletion that leads to an imbalance, the tree either requires a single or double rotation based on the level of the imbalance. If it's just one level off, a single rotation is sufficient; if two levels, then a double rotation.

So putting this together, imbalances in AVL trees that require multiple rotations are those where the insertion or deletion causes the height difference to exceed one at more than one level down from the root. This necessitates the use of rotation operations to rebalance the tree back to its balanced state.

Imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when inserting a new node leads to the heights of two subtrees differing by two or more levels, necessitating either single or double rotations.

**Answer:**

Imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations are those where inserting a new node causes two nodes to shift during insertion or deletion, requiring rotation operations. Specifically:

1. **Single Rotation:** When the imbalance occurs at only one level.
2. **Double Rotation:** When the imbalance is present at two levels.

These imbalances necessitate either single or double rotations to rebalance the tree back to its balanced state."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. From the context provided, it seems like the user has some knowledge about data structures and trees, specifically AVL trees, binary search trees, and other related concepts.

First, I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. The key property of an AVL tree is that the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, which in turn keeps operations like insertion, deletion, and search efficient with average time complexity close to O(log n).

Now, imbalances in a BST can occur due to several reasons. Common causes include nodes being inserted as left-heavy or right-heavy, leading to imbalanced subtrees where one side is significantly taller than the other. This imbalance can cause performance issues because self-balancing trees like AVL trees require rotations to restore their balance.

The context mentions several topics related to tree balancing:
- Trees with 04 - Data Replication.pdf: Doesn't seem directly relevant.
- Trees from 02 - Foundations.pdf (page 12, chunk Binary Search Tree): Also not directly relevant.
- Trees from 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 9, Weighted vs Unweighted): Not directly related to AVL trees.
- Trees from 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 11, Cyclic vs Acyclic): Again, not relevant here.

Looking at the other parts:
- From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 13, Trees 14): Discusses trees in general.
- From 02 - Foundations.pdf (page 12, Binary Search Tree): The same as above.
- From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 9, Weighted vs Unweighted): Also about trees but not specifically AVL.

Since the context doesn't cover AVL trees directly except in some sections that might be off-topic, I need to infer based on standard AVL tree properties. In an AVL tree, a single insertion can cause one node's subtree to become unbalanced by one level. For example, inserting a new node as the left child of a parent node where its right subtree is now two levels taller.

To maintain balance, we might have to perform rotations at that level. The type of rotation depends on whether it's an in-order or pre-order traversal:

1. **Pre-order Rotation**: When a right-heavy tree needs adjustment.
2. **In-order Rotation**: When balancing occurs due to other factors beyond the immediate insertion.

However, I think more accurately, when inserting into a node where its left child is now two levels deeper, we might need to perform either a left or right rotation depending on the specific situation. For example:
- If the newly inserted node has only a right subtree that's too long by one level, a pre-order (right) rotation would balance it.
- Alternatively, if the insertion causes an imbalance in such a way that requires multiple levels of adjustments, multiple rotations might be necessary.

So, to sum up, imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations when inserting into nodes where the height difference between subtrees exceeds one, necessitating either pre-order or in-order rotations to restore balance.

In an AVL tree, imbalances occur when the heights of two child subtrees differ by more than one node. These imbalances arise commonly during insertions and deletions because they can lead to unbalanced trees with average time complexity close to O(n). 

To maintain balance, multiple rotations are required. Specifically, when inserting a new node into a position that causes one subtree to be significantly taller, the tree may require either a pre-order (right) or in-order rotation to restore balance and height differences of at most one. These rotations adjust the tree's structure to ensure efficient operations."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause it to require multiple rotations to rebalance. Let me start by recalling what an AVL tree is. An AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one for every node. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, which helps maintain efficient operations like search and insertion.

Imbalance in a BST usually happens when either the left or right subtree has a significantly different height than the other. For example, if the left subtree is much taller than the right, it can cause issues because searches or insertions might take longer due to deeper paths being taken. But how does this imbalance lead to multiple rotations?

I remember that in an AVL tree, when a new node is inserted and causes the tree to become unbalanced, there are different cases depending on which subtree exceeds the balance. Let's break it down:

1. **Case 1: Inserting into the left child**  
   Suppose we're inserting a node in the left subtree that makes its height exceed the right by one or more levels. In this case, the tree becomes unbalanced at the root node. To fix this, we need to move the taller subtree up as high as possible, which usually means performing two rotations: a left rotation on the root and then another left rotation on the new parent.

2. **Case 2: Inserting into the right child**  
   Similarly, if inserting into the right subtree causes it to be one or more levels taller than the left, we again have an imbalance that requires balancing. The process here is similar but involves moving up from the root downwards, which also results in two rotations.

3. **Case 3: Inserting above the first node**  
   This case applies when inserting a node causes an imbalance at the point where it was inserted into the subtree. For instance, if we insert the second node to the left of the root, this can lead to multiple rotations because the insertion might cause the tree to become unbalanced in both directions.

4. **Case 4: Inserting above another child**  
   If inserting a node causes an imbalance at one of the existing nodes that was previously balanced (like when we had two nodes and inserted one into the left, which made it taller), this also requires multiple rotations. The balancing process here would involve moving up to the root again after each insertion.

Each case involves situations where more than just moving a single node is needed because the structure becomes unstable in both directions. For example, inserting the second node can cause an imbalance that requires two left rotations from the root (one on each side). Similarly, inserting above other nodes or when balancing between two existing nodes would also need multiple adjustments.

I think I remember reading somewhere about this before. When a tree has more than one balance violation simultaneously, it's called a 'double imbalance' case. In such cases, the AVL tree needs to perform multiple rotations from different parts of the tree to rebalance itself, which can be inefficient compared to other balancing strategies like splaying.

So, in summary, the imbalances that require multiple rotations are those where inserting a node causes significant height differences across multiple nodes, necessitating several adjustments beyond simple single rotations.
</think>

The imbalances that require multiple rotations in an AVL tree occur when a new node insertion results in more than one subtree violating the balance condition. Specifically:

1. **Single Rotation (Case 1 & 2):** When inserting into a child subtree causes it to be significantly taller, two rotations are needed—first moving the root up if necessary, then adjusting either side.
2. **Inserting Above First Node (Case 3):** Inserting the second node can cause unbalanced nodes in both subtrees, requiring two consecutive left rotations from the root.
3. **Inserting Above Balanced Nodes (Case 4):** When inserting into a subtree that was previously balanced but now becomes unbalanced after insertion, multiple rotations are needed to balance it.

These cases result in inefficiencies like double imbalances and require more complex rebalancing steps, such as splaying, compared to single rotations."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
