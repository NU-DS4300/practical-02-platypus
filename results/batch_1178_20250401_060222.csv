Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j and its history. From the context provided, it seems that Neo4j was introduced as a graph database system in 2011 with some related documents. 

Looking at the context, there are two PDFs mentioned: one on page 2 of Neo4j's Query Language and Plugins, which talks about Cypher as a visual way to match patterns and relationships. The other is page 1 of Neo4j's A Graph Database System, which explains that it supports both transactional and analytical processing. Both documents mention that Neo4j was created in 2011. 

Additionally, the document on Introduction to Graph Data Model pages 20-22 mentions similar discussions about graph databases, including ACID compliance and distributed computing. There's also a reference to Microsoft CosmoDB, which is an open-source alternative to Neo4j. The context also notes that similarity scores indicate that Neo4j was developed around the same time as other NoSQL databases.

So putting this all together, it seems that Neo4j's graph query language was introduced in 2011 based on the PDFs and references provided.

Neo4j's graph query language was introduced in 2011. 

**Answer:** Neo4j's graph query language was invented in 2011.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Review Context Information**: The context includes several PDF documents about Neo4j, which discuss its introduction and its support for graph-based data processing.
   
2. **Identify Key Dates**: 
   - From the context, it's clear that both ""Neo4j.pdf"" pages 2 and 1 mention the creation of Neo4j in 2011.
   - The introduction of graph query language was discussed in the context, indicating its development around that year.

3. **Consider Related References**: 
   - Introduction to Graph Data Model pages suggest discussions on graph databases and their processing capabilities.
   - Similarity scores indicate that Neo4j aligns with other NoSQL databases, emphasizing a similar timeline for its introduction.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the context and related documents, Neo4j's graph query language was introduced in 2011.

**Final Answer:**
The graph query language of Neo4j was invented in 2011.

Alright, the user is asking when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. I remember that Neo4j has both a SQL-based and a graph-oriented query language, which they call Cypher. The context provided mentions two PDFs about Cypher and other plugins like APOC and Graph Data Science.

Looking at the first PDF, it says Cypher is created in 2011 for ""Graph Data Science."" That seems to be the year when Neo4j's graph query language was introduced. I don't see any conflicting information from the other documents that would suggest a different origin, so I can confidently say that Cypher was first created in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was invented in 2011.

Answer: Cypher was invented in 2011."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, I see several documents about Neo4j. The first document talks about Cypher and APOC Plugins, which are parts of the database infrastructure. It mentions that Neo4j supports a graph query language but doesn't specify its invention date.

Looking further, there's a document from 09 about the introduction to the graph data model. This might be useful because it explains how Neo4j works with nodes and relationships. The section on adding an edge with no variable names includes creating users (nodes) and connecting them, which supports a query language that allows specifying these connections.

There's also another document from 10 about the Cypher syntax for graph databases. It mentions that Neo4j provides a visual way to match patterns and relationships, indicating that the language is designed with a user-friendly interface for querying nodes and edges efficiently.

The introduction to the graph data model also supports the idea of a query language, mentioning ACID compliance and efficient processing in distributed computing environments. This suggests that the language was developed to handle these features effectively.

Considering all this information, while I don't have explicit details on when Neo4j's core query language (like Cypher) was introduced, the context shows it's designed for graph databases with a focus on querying nodes and their relationships. The other documents are more about how the system works, not its origin date.
</think>

Neo4j's graph query language (Cypher) is designed for specifying queries in a graph-based database system rather than introducing it to anyone. While there are no explicit details provided on when Neo4j's core query language was invented, the context indicates that Cypher is tailored for querying nodes and relationships efficiently in a distributed computing environment. The introduction of the data model and its features suggest a focus on user-friendly interfaces for graph queries.

Answer: Neo4j's graph query language, which includes Cypher, is designed to support querying nodes and relationships in a graph-based database system with an efficient and visual approach. While there are no explicit details on when it was first introduced, the context suggests its evolution from a transactional to a graph-query language over time."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
