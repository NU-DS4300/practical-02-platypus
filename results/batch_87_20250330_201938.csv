"According to the provided context, the EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) lifecycle refers to the stages through which an EC2 instance goes during its lifetime. These stages are:

1. Launch - Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. Start/Stop - Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. Terminate - Permanently deleting the instance.
4. Reboot - Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

So, the EC2 lifecycle is essentially the sequence of states that an EC2 instance goes through from creation to deletion or termination."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
