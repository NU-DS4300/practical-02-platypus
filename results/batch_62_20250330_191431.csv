I don't know. The context provided does not mention AVL trees or any information about them, so I'm unable to answer the query accurately. The context appears to be related to database consistency models and data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and binary search trees, but it doesn't contain any information about AVL trees.|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

not relevant to the query, say 'I don't know'."|What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?
I don't know. The provided context appears to be related to computer science, data replication, and database systems, but it does not contain information about AVL trees or their specific requirements for rotations.|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The context provided does not mention AVL trees, so I do not have any information about them. The queries are mostly about NoSQL databases, data replication, and optimistic concurrency. There is no discussion of binary search trees or AVL trees in the given context. If you'd like to provide more information about AVL trees, I'll do my best to help!|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
