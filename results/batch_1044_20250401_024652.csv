"I'm happy to help! However, I must say that the context provided doesn't seem directly related to the query about AVL trees. The texts appear to be discussing data structures, database efficiency, and searching algorithms.

That being said, I'll do my best to provide an answer based on my knowledge of AVL trees. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, which means that it maintains balance by rotating nodes when the height difference between left and right subtrees becomes too large.

According to my understanding of AVL trees, the following imbalances require multiple rotations:

* When the height of one subtree exceeds the other by more than 1 level, we need to perform a rotation (either LL or RR) to bring the imbalance down to 1 level.
* If the imbalance is greater than 1 level and the root node is involved, we might need to perform two consecutive rotations (LLRR or RRLR) to restore balance.

Please note that my answer is based on my understanding of AVL trees and not directly supported by the provided context. If you'd like me to elaborate or provide more information about AVL trees, I'd be happy to help!"|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"A query that seems unrelated to the provided context! However, I'll do my best to answer it accurately.

In an AVL tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure, there are two types of imbalances that can occur:

1. **Left-heavy imbalance**: When the left subtree of a node has more levels than its right subtree.
2. **Right-heavy imbalance**: When the right subtree of a node has more levels than its left subtree.

In either case, if the tree becomes too imbalanced, multiple rotations are required to restore balance and maintain the tree's properties (e.g., height difference between subtrees â‰¤ 1).

To perform these rotations, you can use one or both of the following:

1. **Left rotation**: Rotates the right child up to replace the current node.
2. **Right rotation**: Rotates the left child down to replace the current node.

These operations are typically performed in a way that maintains the AVL tree's balance and ensures the tree remains roughly balanced, which is essential for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Now, I must admit that my expertise in relational databases, NoSQL databases, and AWS didn't directly help with answering this question. But I hope this answer provides a helpful insight into AVL trees!"|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"A question that ventures into the realm of graph data models and trees!

Based on my knowledge of relational databases, NoSQL databases, and AWS as a service, I'd like to say that the context provided doesn't seem directly related to the query about AVL tree imbalances. The contexts appear to be discussing topics such as data duplication, linear scans, graph data models, and moving beyond relational models.

However, I'll do my best to provide an answer based on my understanding of AVL trees.

In an AVL tree, there are two types of imbalances that require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-Left Imbalance**: When a node has both its left child and the left child's left child heavier (i.e., having more nodes), this is considered a left-left imbalance. In such cases, a double rotation (LL-rotation) is required to balance the tree.
2. **Right-Right Imbalance**: Conversely, when a node has both its right child and the right child's right child heavier, this is considered a right-right imbalance. Similarly, a double rotation (RR-rotation) is necessary to restore balance.

These imbalances occur when the height of the left subtree of a node becomes more than one level taller than the height of its right subtree or vice versa. To maintain the tree's balance and ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, these imbalances are resolved through multiple rotations.
