Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through each chunk step by step.

First, there's a chunk from page 22 of ""NoSQL Introduction"" where it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So I can note that down as 16 databases.

Next, on page 23, it goes into more detail about how Redis interacts with the database through commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs. It also talks about durability features: snapshots are saved periodically or appended as a journal. That doesn't seem directly relevant to the count of supported databases, but just noting that.

Looking at page 24, it's about Redis being an in-memory database system that supports various data models including KV stores, graphs, spatial, etc. It mentions that Redis does not handle complex data like time series or vectors, which is interesting, but again, I'm looking for the count here, so I'll focus on the database count.

Then, page 25 talks about Redis being a C++ implementation. It also lists some performance aspects: it can execute up to 100,000 set operations per second and supports rich commands without secondary indexes. That's more about capabilities and limitations, not the count of databases.

On page 26, there's information about Redis Data Types in Python being maintained by the company itself. They mention that Redis-py is used as a standard client for Python, which relates to using Redis within Python scripts but doesn't change the number of supported databases.

Lastly, on page 4300, it mentions that Redis has a Conda environment setup with specific packages and also a GitHub repository pointing to redis/redis-py. This might be relevant if someone is integrating Redis into their Python applications, but again, not affecting the database count.

Putting it all together, I see that throughout the context, Redis supports 16 databases by default as mentioned on page 22. Even though there are other mentions of Redis's features and integration with different languages or platforms, they don't change this base count of supported databases.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases by default.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The context mentions several sections, some discussing Redis as an in-memory database system and others as a Python client for noSQL databases. In one chunk (page 18), it states: ""Redis provides 16 databases by default."" It also lists them as numbered from 0 to 15. So that's 16 databases in total.

Looking at other parts, like the section on Redis Data Types (page 20), it doesn't mention any additional databases beyond the initial 16. Similarly, when discussing Redis servers and their configuration, they talk about port settings but don't add more databases to their count. The sections on Docker setup (pages 21 and 22) also focus on Redis itself without mentioning other database systems.

Therefore, based on this information, Redis supports 16 distinct databases.

Redis provides 16 databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15, with each representing a separate instance of the in-memory data storage system. This is detailed in the context where it states: ""Redis provides 16 databases by default - They are numbered 0 to 15."""|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, let's try to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context.

First, I look at the provided context. It seems to be a list of documents about Redis. Scanning through them:

- In ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22)"", it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default.
- In another document titled ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 23)"", I notice a chunk where Redis states: ""Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database system, but primarily a KV store..."" It doesn't explicitly say the number of databases here. The first mention was 16.
- In ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 24)"", another chunk is present: ""Redis Data Types Keys: - usually strings but can be any binary sequence Values: - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets (unique unsorted string elements)..."" This seems to describe the types, not the number of databases.

There's also a document titled ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf"", which lists some Redis commands and mentions it's the standard client for Python. However, this doesn't provide information on how many databases Redis supports.

Looking back at the query: ""How many databases does Redis support?"" The context provides two main points:
1. Redis defaults to providing 16 databases.
2. Some sections mention that Redis can be used as a KV store but don't specify the total number of supported databases.

I don't see any other documents in the context that specify Redis's database count beyond 16, except when it was presented earlier on page 22. However, I should consider if there are any other sources where Redis is mentioned with more than 16 databases. Scanning through all provided text, I find only the first mention of 16 databases.

Therefore, based on the information given, Redis supports 16 databases by default.

Based on the context provided, Redis supports 16 databases by default.
