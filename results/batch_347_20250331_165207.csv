Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. From the context provided, I can see that there's a section talking about Redis as an in-memory database system. It mentions things like durability and how it handles changes. But looking at the sections, I don't immediately find any details about data types or specific commands related to value storage.

In other parts of the context, especially when discussing the MongoDB document, it lists common values like strings, lists (which are arrays), sets (which are unordered collections), sorted sets, and hashes. However, Redis doesn't cover these exact terms in the provided text. It seems to focus more on how Redis can be used with Python as a client library.

The section about Redis databases by default provides 16 databases but doesn't mention any data types for values. The document also talks about it being a KV store, which stands for Key-Value store, implying that each value is stored with a key associated with it. That makes me think of something like a map where keys and values are both managed by Redis.

I remember reading somewhere that Redis supports sets in Python's redis library through commands like set, exists, etc., but that doesn't provide a list or a dictionary structure for data types. It seems more about managing collections rather than providing direct data type support.

Another point is the section on 4300 Conda Environment mentioning redis. The context there talks about using Redis with Python, which suggests that while Redis can be used to store and manage values as keys and values in a Python application, it doesn't inherently support storing various types of data through its core functionality.

Putting this together, the query is asking specifically for data types supported by Redis. Since the provided context isn't about defining or declaring data types but rather how to interact with Redis within Python, I might need to look elsewhere for more details on Redis's value storage capabilities in a traditional database sense.

I should also consider that sometimes discussions about data types are tied to SQL databases where types matter, but in modern NoSQL contexts like Redis, the focus is more on how keys and values can be managed rather than predefined types. So Redis might not have built-in support for all possible data types as other languages or databases do.

Therefore, based on the information given, I don't see Redis explicitly mentioning any data types it supports for storing values in a traditional sense. It's more about managing key-value pairs and their interactions within Python code using the redis library.

Relevant Data Types Supported by Redis:

- **Strings**: Simple text or binary sequences stored as raw strings.
- **Lists (Arrays)**: Ordered collections of elements.
- **Sets (Unsorted Unordered String Elements)**: Collections where order doesn't matter and duplicates are removed.
- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain insertion order.
- **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Key-value pairs where keys can be any binary sequence, with support for string hashes.

 Redis is primarily a KV store that supports managing key-value pairs through commands like set, exists, etc., rather than providing built-in data type declarations. Its core functionality focuses on handling collections and managing key-value relationships without requiring predefined data types."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which data types Redis supports for holding value in its structure. From what I remember, Redis is an in-memory database, so it's really fast and doesn't need to load data from a server. It can handle everything on the fly.

Looking at the context provided, there are several parts that talk about Redis' functionality and commands. The key points related to value types are spread out across different sections. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, it mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system with durability, meaning data can be rolled forward if a failure occurs. It supports sets, lists, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. I think these are the primary types, but maybe there are others too.

Then, when discussing how to interact with Redis through Python using the redis module, it shows examples of setting keys, getting values, incrementing counts, and retrieving values. The output from get is a list or array, which suggests that values can be various types depending on how you access them. So maybe not just strings but other data types as well.

Looking at the section about command list in Redis in Context 13, it says that Redis supports commands for different data structures. It mentions using r.set(), r.mset(), r.get(), r.incr(), and so on. These commands are used to manipulate keys, which implies that values can be various types as long as they're stored under the correct key.

The part about value interactions in Section 23-25 talks about getting multiple values by passing a list of keys into mget(). This means you can retrieve multiple values at once. It also mentions that these values are processed, which suggests that the data could be numbers, strings, or other types depending on what's stored.

Section 4300 with Conda Environment explains that Redis-py is maintained by Redis and comes with various libraries for Python users. This environment setup means that you can use Redis commands within a Python script to interact with Redis data.

Putting all this together: Redis supports values as strings, but also lists, sets, hashes, and geospatial data. The specific command examples show how these are stored under keys in the database. Since Redis allows multiple value storage via mget(), it's possible that values can be any type that's valid for a key, like integers, strings, etc.

I don't see anything in the context about other data types beyond what's shown here. So, based on the information provided, the primary value types supported are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. However, using mget() can retrieve any values as needed, which might allow for more flexibility with different data types.

I should also consider that Redis is designed to be flexible, so it's possible that even though examples show specific types, the underlying storage can handle a wide range of data. The documentation in Section 4 likely provides a comprehensive list, but based on what's mentioned here, strings seem to be the most common.
</think>

Redis supports several data types for holding values. These include:

1. **Strings**: Values are stored as strings, which can contain any sequence of characters.
2. **Lists**: Can store multiple elements in an ordered structure.
3. **Sets**: Store unique elements without duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain order.
5. **Hashes**: Map keys to values, where the key is typically a string or other type, and each value can be any binary sequence.

Additionally, Redis allows multiple value storage through commands like mget(), which can retrieve various data types as needed. The specific command examples in the context indicate that values are processed upon retrieval, suggesting flexibility with different data types such as integers, strings, etc.

**Answer:** Redis supports strings, lists, sets (both sorted), and hashes. It allows multiple value storage using commands like mget(), which can retrieve various data types depending on the keys stored."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, let me try to figure out how to answer this query. The user has provided a bunch of context about Redis and noSQL databases. They're asking me to name the data types supported by Redis for values. 

First, I'll look through the context they've given. Scanning each paragraph, I see mentions of various aspects of Redis, such as its in-memory nature, durability features, different database models like KV store, graphs, geospatial data, and more. There's also a section about how Redis is used with Python, specifically mentioning a client library called redis.

In the Redis DB section, it lists several types: strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which are unique unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. But wait, geospatial data is more of a noSQL feature than a specific data type in Redis itself. So maybe I should exclude that.

Looking at the other sections, there's no mention of any specific data types except for the types it can store, like strings, lists, etc. There's also mentions of string commands and methods, but those are more about how to interact with Redis rather than what data types they support.

So putting this together, Redis supports several types: strings (any binary sequence), lists (linked lists), sets (unique elements, unsorted), sorted sets, hashes (strings mapping to strings). The geospatial data note suggests I should not include that here. 

I also see that the user previously mentioned a connection from File > New > Data Source > Redis in a context about connecting Redis with other tools, like Python. That section doesn't mention specific data types but rather the environment setup for using Redis in conjunction with a ML framework.

Therefore, I think the main point is to list the data types that Redis supports based on the context provided. Even though geospatial data is more of a noSQL type, it's mentioned as such in one section, so it's still relevant to include if it falls under values but maybe not specifically ""values."" Since the user asked about values, I think including all supported types would be comprehensive.

I'll make sure to list each data type clearly: strings, lists, sets (both sorted and non-sorted), hashes. Also, since Redis doesn't support complex queries other than lookups by key, but that's more of an index structure rather than a specific value type.

So the final answer should be the list of types: Strings, Lists, Sets (sorted and non-sorted), Hashes. I'll present this in a clear format as per the user's example.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. **Strings**
2. **Lists** (each element is a string)
3. **Sets** (unique strings, unsorted)
4. **Sorted Sets** (unique sorted strings)
5. **Hashes** (strings → strings)

These types allow storing various kinds of data while maintaining efficient lookups based on keys."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
