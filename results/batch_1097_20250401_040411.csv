Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through each clue one by one.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" section, there's a chunk that says Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That immediately tells me Redis has 16 databases.

Then, looking at the next document titled ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" page 12, it mentions Redis in the context of KV stores. There are details about KV stores, graph databases, full-text search, vector databases, time series data, and others, but I don't see any mention of a specific number here.

In another part of the same document, page 13, there's a chunk discussing Redis ML and DS/ML sections. It mentions examples like SimpliÔ¨Åed Example where they show two models (OneOp and TwoOps) with 27 lines each. However, this doesn't add any new information about the number of databases Redis supports.

There are also sources linked to FeatureStore and MADMArML that mention feature stores in ML contexts but again, they don't specify the count of Redis databases here.

So, the only explicit information is the 16 mentioned in the first context. The other documents either discuss different aspects of Redis without mentioning the number of databases or provide examples related to ML models which don't directly relate to database counts.

The first source explicitly states that Redis supports 16 databases by default. Other documents touch on topics like KV stores, graph databases, and feature stores but do not provide additional information about the number of databases Redis supports.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through each paragraph carefully.

First, in ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" page 22, it says that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It mentions no other names associated and talks about direct interaction commands related to k/v pairs, which I think refers to key-value stores.

Then, in ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 17, it lists Redis as an open-source in-memory database that's primarily a KV store but can be used with various models. It also ranks Redis among the top KV stores and gives it a ranking of 18 out of 26.

In ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" page 12 discusses Redis being used within Python, specifically mentioning Redis in context 13 where Redis is discussed again as part of ML and DS/ML contexts. The specific example given is a simplified Redis example for feature stores on sourceforge.com, which reinforces that Redis supports multiple types of databases.

Looking at the ""Redis + Python.pdf"" pages from 12 to 15, it further explains how Redis can be integrated into ML and data science applications through Feature Store, showing its versatility beyond just storing data.

Now, putting this together: The initial paragraph clearly states there are 16 default databases. However, the next paragraph doesn't specify the exact number; it just mentions Redis as a primary type of database but emphasizes that it's versatile for different uses. The third paragraph talks about integrating Redis into Python, which is more about using it in an environment rather than specifying the count of actual databases.

So, while the first paragraph explicitly states 16 databases, other sections don't provide exact numbers beyond that. Therefore, I should stick to the information given and state that Redis supports 16 databases by default.

Alright, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through each section carefully.

First, in the NoSQL introduction document (05), it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. So that's 16 mentioned there.

Looking further down into the Redis DB section under NoSQL (page 22-23) again mentions 16 databases numbered from 0 to 15. That reinforces the number of databases Redis supports without any restrictions or additional features beyond those defaults.

I don't see any other mentions or sections that suggest Redis supports more or different types of databases, so I can be confident that Redis handles a total of 16 databases.

Redis supports a total of **16 databases**. These are numbered from 0 to 15 and are considered in-memory data structures."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
