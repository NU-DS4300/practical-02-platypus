Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through it again carefully.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It also states there's no other name associated with them. So, each number corresponds to a unique database. That makes sense because numbering usually implies sequential support.

I don't see any information about variations or different configurations beyond the default 16. The context doesn't mention anything else, so I can't assume Redis supports more than these numbered databases.

Therefore, the answer should be that Redis supports 16 databases in total.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me read through it again.

The context says that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It mentions that there's no other name associated with them. So, each database is identified by a number starting from 0 up to 15. That means the first one is 0, and the last one is 15.

To find out how many databases that makes, I can count the numbers from 0 to 15 inclusive. Let me list them out: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

Let's count those. Starting from 0 as the first one, that's 1. Then each subsequent number adds another, so it should be 16 in total. Yeah, that makes sense because they say 16 databases numbered 0 to 15.

So, putting that together, Redis supports 16 databases.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. The query is ""How many databases does Redis support?"" and there's a specific section in the PDF that mentions something about 16 databases by default with numbers from 0 to 15. 

First, I'll read through the context again. It says, ""Redis provides 16 databases by default - They are numbered 0 to 15."" So that directly addresses how many databases Redis supports. The answer is clearly 16.

I don't see any other information in the context that suggests Redis doesn't support more than these 16 or if it mentions additional ones. Since the PDF part specifically talks about 0-15, I'll stick with that number.

Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15.
