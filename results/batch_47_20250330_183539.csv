"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

These data types are mentioned in the context as the different types of values that can be stored in Redis, along with their descriptions."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, specifically from pages 19 and 20 of ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

These value data types allow you to store and retrieve complex data structures in Redis."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"A great question!

According to the context, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. **Strings**
2. **Lists** (linked lists)
3. **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements)
4. **Sorted Sets**
5. **Hashes** (string → string)

These data types allow Redis to store and manipulate various types of key-value pairs, making it a versatile in-memory database."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
