"According to the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the different states that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance can be in. These states include:

* Launch: When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
* Start/Stop: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
* Terminate: Permanently deleting the instance.
* Reboot: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These lifecycle stages are mentioned in the context from page 4 of ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf""."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"Based on the provided context, I can answer your question accurately.

According to page 4 of the ""From 12 - EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" document, the EC2 lifecycle consists of four stages:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

So, the EC2 lifecycle refers to these four stages that describe the life cycle of an EC2 instance from launch to termination or reboot."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
