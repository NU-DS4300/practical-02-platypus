Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing and retrieving values. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, there's a section from ""NoSQL Intro"" that mentions Redis Data Types Keys. It says that keys can be strings or any binary sequence. So I know that in Redis, keys are typically strings because they're used to identify sets or arrays. But it also mentions that values can be other things like lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data.

Then there's a section titled ""String Commands"" where it shows examples of using the Redis commands mset, mget, rset, rget, and rinc with some sample code. This helps clarify how these data types are used in practice. For example, mset is for setting values, mget retrieves them, rset updates them, rget gets them again, and rinc increments.

I also see a link to another document about Redis in the context of Data Science and Machine Learning. It mentions that Redis can be integrated with ML frameworks like Madaway withML, which suggests that Redis data types are relevant there as well.

Putting this all together, Redis supports various binary sequences for keys, such as strings or other binary data, but the values associated with these keys can be more complex structures like lists, sets, hashes, etc. The context also provides examples of how these operations work in practice.

Redis supports a variety of binary data types for both keys and values. Keys are typically represented by strings, though they can also include other binary sequences. For values:

- **List**: Collections of elements where duplicates are not allowed.
- **Set**: Unordered collection of unique elements.
- **Sorted Set**: Similar to a set but maintains order.
- **Hash**: Unique keys mapped to values; each key must be unique and can contain any data type.
- **Geospatial Data**: Specific types like points, lines, polygons, etc.

Examples:
- `r.set('key', value)` sets a value under the given key.
- `r.get(key)` retrieves or updates a value associated with the key.
- `r.incr(key)` increments the count of a value in the set.
- `r.expim(key, 60)` resets the time until the next expime.

Redis is widely used in data science and machine learning due to its flexibility and integration capabilities."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values. Looking at the context provided, I see several sections discussing Redis concepts and specific commands.

In section NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf on page 19, it mentions that Redis Data Types Keys can be strings or any binary sequence. But the query is about values, so I'll focus there.

Then in Redis + Python.pdf, pages 4-5, there are examples of string commands like mset, mget, set, and incr. These show how various data types like strings, lists, sets, hashes, and geospatial data can be stored. The commands also return specific types such as arrays (lists), dictionaries (sets?), strings, integers, booleans, etc.

Additionally, section NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf on page 19 has bullet points explaining different data types supported by Redis, but that's more about how they're used rather than what they are. The Python examples provided in the other section give clear examples of the data types involved.

So, putting it all together, the main data types Redis supports for values include strings, lists (like arrays), sets, hashes, and geospatial data with similarity checks.

The primary data types Redis supports for storing values are:

1. **Strings**: Used for text or alphanumeric data.
2. **Lists (Arrays)**: Represent collections of items accessed by indexes.
3. **Sets**: Store unique elements without a defined order.
4. **Hashes**: Offer key-value pairs, often used for efficient lookups.
5. **Geospatial Data**: With similarity checks, storing coordinates or addresses.

These data types are supported across Redis commands and examples provided in the context."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out which data types Redis supports for values based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant section step by step.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro"" section, it mentions that Redis supports various binary sequences as values. The text lists several examples like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. That's a good starting point because all these are common data types in programming and storage systems.

Next, I look at each of the subsequent documents related to ""Redis + Python."" The first document (page 5) talks about string commands with mset, print, get, set, incr. It shows an example where mset adds keys with values, print retrieves them into a list, and mget returns the values as a list. These examples use strings as keys or to store data.

Then there's another document (page 4) that demonstrates using r.set to add an address with a count, then gets it back after incrementing by 1. This example uses numerical values like counts, which supports integer and possibly other numeric types as values in Redis.

The ""Redis in DS/ML"" section mentionsMad accelerated ML, but doesn't specify the data types for values directly. However, it's part of the context that supports machine learning features, so perhaps it implies that the data types used are compatible with those supported elsewhere.

Looking at the ""Redis in Context 13,"" even though I don't have access to its content, it likely continues from previous discussions about data storage and retrieval. It references a source on Mad accelerated ML, which is an extension of Redis for machine learning, so it reinforces that Redis handles various data types as values.

Putting this all together, the main data types Redis supports include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, integers, and possibly more specialized types depending on context. The specific commands in the Python documents show how these can be used with examples like mset, print, get, set, incr, which involve various keys and values.
</think>

Redis is a powerful data structure that supports a variety of data types for storing and retrieving information. Based on the provided context:

1. **Strings**: The text mentions strings as a common data type for both keys and values in Redis.

2. **Numeric Data Types**: Examples include using counts (e.g., r.incr(‘clickCount:/abc’) to increment by 1), which supports integer and possibly other numeric types.

3. **Binary Sequences**: Redis is known for handling binary sequences, which can represent strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and more.

4. **Sorted Sets**: A feature of Redis that stores unique elements in a specific order.

5. **Hashes**: Redis supports hashes as values, often used to store functions or objects.

These data types are supported across different sections, including use cases, commands, and extensions likeMad accelerated ML, reinforcing Redis's versatility in handling various types of data."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
