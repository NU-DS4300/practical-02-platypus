Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Redis supports as data types for values. I remember that Redis has some specific structures, especially when dealing with data. From what I've read before, they talk about keys and sets. Oh wait, the user mentioned strings can be any binary sequence, so maybe there are more than just strings.

I recall seeing in the context that it mentions lists, which are like linked lists where each element points to another list. That makes sense because when you use mget with multiple keys, it returns a list of values. So that's one data type beyond strings.

Then there's something about sets, but sets can't have duplicates since they're unique and unsorted. So if I try to store an item twice in a set, the second occurrence might not get picked up when mget is called. That seems important because it affects how you use sets for managing data without duplicates.

Hashes or hash functions are mentioned too—these take inputs and produce outputs. They could be used for things like tracking events where each event maps to a unique identifier. But I'm not entirely sure how that works with Redis commands. Maybe when you store an item in a key, the hash function increments a counter?

And then there's the part about geospatial data 20. Oh, right! Geospatial data is stored as points on a sphere or plane, which makes sense for location-based services. So that adds another data type supported beyond simple strings and collections.

Putting it all together, Redis supports strings, but also lists, sets (which are unique and unsorted), hashes, and geospatial data 20. I should make sure to include all of these in the answer so that anyone reading it can understand exactly what's available.

Redis supports several data types for values beyond simple strings:

1. **Strings**: Any binary sequence.
2. **Lists**: Represented as linked lists, allowing collection of items.
3. **Sets**: Unique items with no duplicates and unsorted nature.
4. **Hashes (Hash Functions)**: Outputting sequences based on inputs, often used for event tracking.
5. **Geospatial Data 20**: Points or locations on a sphere/planar surface.

These data types enhance Redis's versatility in managing diverse data structures efficiently."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and its data types.

I remember that Redis has a set of built-in data types. The user provided some context which seems helpful. In the 05 document, they mentioned that Redis supports strings as values but can also hold other binary sequences like lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data with similarity. 

Looking at the 06 document about Python, I see examples of using r.set, r.get, r.incr. When you set a key-value pair, then increment it, and retrieve it, the value changes. This suggests that values can be simple types like integers or strings, but they can also be more complex structures.

I should consider if there are any other data types beyond strings. I think Redis might support arrays and tuples as well because those are common data structures. Also, when you access a value using keys in Python, it returns these data types. For example, the first two examples show lists being returned, which makes sense for data that can be multiple values at once.

I'm trying to recall if there are any other specific data types mentioned beyond strings and others like arrays or tuples. From what I remember, Redis doesn't have a built-in type for dates or booleans; those might need to be converted into strings. Also, when dealing with JSON-like structures, they would probably use similar methods as in the Python examples.

I should also think about how these data types are used. Since Redis is often associated with distributed systems and handling large datasets, it's common to have complex values that aren't single primitives but collections of data points.

Putting this together, the supported data types for values in Redis would include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data with similarity. I might also be missing some edge cases or specific scenarios where these data types come into play, but from what's provided, that seems to cover it.

Redis supports a variety of data types for values, including:

1. **Strings**: Represented as any binary sequence (though typically used for text).
2. ** Lists**: Multi-element collections (e.g., in the examples given).
3. ** Sets**: Unsorted unique elements (e.g., in the example where 'clickCount:/abc' was retrieved as a list of values).
4. **Sorted Sets**: Ordered sets with unique elements.
5. **Hashes**: Mappings from keys to strings, returning binary sequences.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Represented by similarity data types for geospatial coordinates.

These data types allow Redis to handle complex and multi-dimensional datasets effectively."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which data types Redis supports for holding values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and its data types.

From the context provided, I remember that in the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" it mentions that Redis Data Types Keys can be strings or any binary sequence. So, that gives me a starting point: strings are one type of value in Redis.

Looking further into ""Redis + Python.pdf"" on pages 5 and onwards, there's some code examples showing commands related to sets, lists, hashes, etc. These seem like other data types Redis supports for values.

In the example on page 5, they show using mset with a dictionary where each key maps to a value. That's definitely a set type because it can store multiple items with unique keys. On page 6, there are commands that suggest handling various structures like lists and sets, which further confirms their use.

There's also an example on page 14 where they create a key in the store, increment the count using r.incr(), and then retrieve it to get the current value. This indicates that Redis can handle numeric values as well, not just strings or binary sequences. So numbers are another data type supported.

Additionally, there's a link provided: ""Redis in DS/ML 15 Source: https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/"", which might show how Redis is used within ML (maybe machine learning contexts) for feature stores. This could involve more structured data types, though I'm not sure if that changes the types themselves or just their use cases.

The last source link points to ""Redis in Context 13,"" but since that's a bit behind the provided context, I can't access its content. However, given the previous examples and information, it seems that Redis supports all standard data types: strings, sets, lists, hashes (which are functions that return values), and also numeric types like integers and floats.

I should double-check if there's anything else mentioned or if any of these data types are used differently in the provided context. The query is about naming the data types supported for values, so I think I've covered all the examples given—strings, sets, lists, hashes, and numbers.

The data types supported by Redis for holding values include:

1. **Strings**: Can be of any length and contain any characters, including special symbols.
2. **Sets**: Store unique elements with ordered keys.
3. **Lists (Sorted Lists)**: Ordered collections of items without duplicates.
4. **Hashes/Key-Value Pairs**: Bind strings to values, useful for associative storage.
5. **Numeric Values**: Include integers, floating-point numbers, and booleans.

These types are supported for various operations in Redis, such as storing structured data, managing sets, handling lists, incrementing counts, and retrieving values efficiently."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
