Okay, the user is asking when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. I remember reading that Neo4J is a graph database built on Java, and it does support Cypher for querying graphs. I should check how old this was.

First, from the context provided, there are two documents: one about Neo4j's Graph Query Language (GQL) in page 2 of Volume 10 and another from Volume 10 about the GQL itself on page 3. It says Neo4J supports both transactional and analytical processing. That's a key point.

Looking back, the query mentioned was when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Since the documents talk about how Neo4J uses GQL for graph querying, I can infer that the invention date is during the development of the Neo4J project. The introduction to the document mentions it supports both transactional and analytical processing, which are common features in databases.

So, putting it together, the answer should be the year 2017 when Neo4J was introduced as a graph database system with GQL support. The user's query is about the invention of GQL itself, not the project's introduction date, but based on the context provided, that's accurate.

Neo4j's graph query language (GQL) was introduced in 2017.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. The context provided is a bunch of documents about Neo4J, which is a graph database. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, I see that there are several files or sections in the context discussing Neo4J. One of them is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011..."". This mentions that Cypher was created in 2011. I recall that Cypher is indeed the syntax used for querying graphs in Neo4J.

Another section talks about ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 3, chunk Neo4j in Docker Compose 4)"". It also references a docker-compose.yaml file where there are parameters like NEO4J_AUTH and others. However, that's more about how Neo4J is set up within the Docker framework rather than the original creation time of its query language.

Looking back at the document from ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 0, chunk DS 4300..."" I see it mentions similar concepts but again doesn't directly address when Cypher was created. 

I also check if Neo4J is part of an ongoing project or development process. Neo4J has been around for a while; some documentation and code are older, but the original query language introduction must be from 2011 as indicated by that ""Cypher created in 2011"" paragraph.

So putting it all together, the key point is in that specific section where it's clearly stated that Cypher was developed in 2011. That should answer the question accurately.

Neo4J's graph query language, which uses Cypher, was introduced in 2011. This information is well-documented within the provided context, particularly in the document titled ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011""."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Let me see... From the context provided, there are a bunch of documents about Neo4J and related topics like the graph database system. But none directly mention the development timeline or invention date for its graph query language.

Hmm, let's look at the document on ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" which mentions that Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data. It also talks about its ACID compliance and distributed computing capabilities. But that's more about the database system itself rather than the query language.

There's another document titled ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011..."". Oh, wait, this one mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011. But it doesn't specify the origin or when exactly it was invented.

The other documents discuss graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and PageRank but again, they don't give any information on when the query language for neo4j was developed. I'm trying to piece this together: Neo4j as a database system came out in 2011. The Cypher language used is described as being created that same year. So maybe the query language (Cypher) was introduced around 2011.

Wait, but the user's question is about when neo4j itself was invented, not the query language per se. Since Neo4j emerged in 2011, that might be the answer they're looking for. But I should double-check if there are any references elsewhere where it specifies when Neo4j was created or introduced.

Looking back at the documents: The first one on page 2, volume 2 of ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011. So maybe neo4j's graph query language was introduced a few years before that? Or perhaps it's considered part of the system from the start.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think the key point is that Neo4j as a database system came out in 2011, and since the Cypher query language is mentioned alongside it, perhaps that's when it was introduced. Alternatively, maybe the query language was part of the system from version 1 onwards.

I should also consider if there are any other documents or context snippets that might shed light on this. The mention of ACID compliance and distributed computing aligns with the database system but doesn't directly relate to when the query language was invented.

So, in summary, based on the provided information, Neo4j emerged in 2011 as a graph database system. If the Cypher query language is considered part of the system from that time onward, then maybe it's introduced around 2011. However, without more specific references to when exactly Neo4j was first developed, I can't be entirely certain.

The query language for Neo4J, referred to as Cypher, was introduced in 2011. Therefore, the graph query language within Neo4J is likely based on this introduction.
