Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. I know that Redis is a popular noSQL database, but I'm not exactly sure about its history. Let me start by recalling what I remember from the context provided. The context mentions ""Redis in Context 13,"" which probably refers to a section of a document discussing Redis within an AWS context.

In the query, it's asking when Redis was released. From my understanding, Redis started as a project that aimed to create a flexible database for web applications. I remember hearing about some early versions before official release. 

I think the initial release was in 2013. There were two versions of Redis: Redis.js and Redis SQL. The JavaScript version was a significant milestone because it introduced an open-source JavaScript engine for the web, which helped make Redis more accessible to developers using JavaScript.

So, Redis.js was released around early 2014. Then, in April 2015, the full Redis database engine came out as Redis SQL. That's when Redis became the official product and became more widely used on the web.

I'm pretty sure Redis is still active today and supports multiple platforms like Node.js, Python, and even databases like MongoDB. The version has been updated several times, including a newer release around 2018 that introduced new features like indexing for JSON data.

Wait, I should double-check if there were any other major releases before the official JavaScript engine. Oh, right, Redis.js was the first version, and Redis SQL came next in April. So Redis was released with Redis.js in early 2014 and then Redis SQL in April 2015 as its official product.

I think that's correct because I remember seeing that Redis.js was a big deal when it was released, and it's still widely used today. The newer versions have added features but don't change the release timeline.

Redis started with Redis.js in early 2014, and Redis SQL was its official product by April 2015.

**Answer:**

Redis was first released as Redis.js in early 2014 and became the official product with Redis SQL in April 2015."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. From the context provided, it mentions that Redis is related to NoSQL databases and can be used with Python. There's a file named ""Redis in Context 13"" which is linked as an example.

I remember that Redis was initially developed by Google. They were working on a distributed system back in 2004. But I think they released their first version of the library around 2006. That must have been around December or January. The release date for the popular Redis client, like Redis.js, is usually around November to December each year.

So, putting it together: Redis was developed by Google starting in 2004, and the first version came out in 2006. By then, they started selling a library called Redis.js or Redis Python package, which made it accessible for more people, including those who might not be familiar with server-side languages.

Wait, I should check if there are any other important dates. I recall that Redis 1.x was released in 2006 and has had several updates since then. Each version is likely to add new features or improve performance. But the main release date for the product itself isn't a single year but rather multiple years with specific release points.

So, summarizing: Redis started as a distributed system starting in 2004 by Google, released their first client around 2006, and since then, versions have been continuously updated to include new features.

Redis was initially developed by Google as a distributed system starting from 2004. The first version of the popular Redis client, like Redis.js or Redis Python package, was released around 2006 in November. Each version since then has been updated to include additional features.

Answer: Redis was developed by Google starting in 2004 and its initial release as a library started around 2006 with the first version available at that time."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, the user is asking about when Redis was released. I know that Redis was actually created as an open-source project a few years back. So, Redis isn't a release itself but a framework. I remember seeing Redis 15 in the context provided, which matches the year mentioned. Since the answer was given as 2014, that makes sense because Redis started around then and has been widely used ever since.

I should make sure to correct the user's misunderstanding about Redis being an open-source project. Itâ€™s important to clarify that it's not a release but a framework to avoid confusion. Also, mentioning its applications like ML, big data, and cloud-native ensures they understand the context.

Redis was created as an open-source project in 2014 and has since become a widely used framework for managing in-memory databases, including those utilized in machine learning (ML), big data analytics, and cloud-native technologies."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
