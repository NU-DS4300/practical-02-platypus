Okay, I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations to fix. Let me start by recalling what an AVL tree is. It's a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced and operations like insertion, deletion, and search are efficient with O(log n) time complexity.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree occur when this balance condition is violated. Specifically, if a node's left subtree is significantly taller than its right subtree or vice versa. The question is about how to rebalance such imbalances by rotating nodes. 

I remember that rotations are used to restore the height difference of 1 between the child subtrees. There are two types of rotations: single and double. A single rotation involves moving a node from the left subtree (left rotation) or the right subtree (right rotation). However, if an AVL tree has an imbalance that requires more than one such rotation, what does it look like?

I think about cases where the balance is achieved with two levels of rotations. For instance, in some cases, especially when dealing with data inserts that cause multiple layers to shift, you might need a single node on the left side (right rotation) and then another node on the right side (left rotation). So, it's not just one rotation but two.

To visualize this, consider an AVL tree where inserting a new element causes the root to have more elements in its left subtree. To rebalance, you might need to perform a right rotation on the root and then check again if the balance is maintained. If it isn't, you perform another rotation from the child that was rotated. This would require two rotations for an imbalance that can't be fixed with a single adjustment.

I also recall that in some cases of insertions, especially when elements are inserted in such a way that multiple layers need to shift before the balance is restored, this might involve multiple rotations. It's important because each rotation affects the rest of the tree structure, which could impact other operations if not handled correctly.

So, putting it all together, imbalances that require multiple rotations are those where an insertion or deletion causes two different levels to become unbalanced. The solution involves performing two separate rotations to bring both subtrees back into balance.

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when the heights of the left and right child subtrees differ by more than one node, necessitating adjustments across multiple levels. These imbalances are resolved with two rotations:

1. **Single Rotation on Left Subtree**: A right rotation is performed to balance the height difference.
2. **Single Rotation on Right Subtree**: After the first rotation, a left rotation is performed to ensure both subtrees remain balanced.

Thus, the key scenario involves restoring balance through sequential adjustments across the tree's structure.

Answer: The imbalances require two rotations, first from the left and then from the right subtree, necessitating separate single rotations."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations to fix. First, I should recall what an AVL tree is. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. So, each node maintains not just its value but also the balance factor, which is the height difference between its right and left subtree.

Imbalances in an AVL tree occur when this balance condition isn't met for any node. There are different types of imbalances. The main ones I remember are:

1. **Left Rotation**: This occurs when a node's right child becomes the new root because the tree is too skewed to the left. An example is if the right subtree is taller than the left.

2. **Right Rotation**: Similarly, this happens when the left subtree becomes the new root because the tree is too skewed to the right.

But wait, these are single rotations and only fix a specific kind of imbalanceâ€”either leaning left or right. However, there's also the case where both left and right imbalances occur simultaneously. That would require not just a left or right rotation but potentially multiple steps to balance the tree.

I think this scenario is called an ""imbalance in a way that requires two rotations."" So when an AVL tree has nodes where both the left and right subtrees are unbalanced, more than one rotation is needed to restore the balance. This situation might involve adjusting multiple levels or requiring deeper rotations on either side.

Let me check if I'm missing any other types of imbalances. Oh, maybe ""Imbalance in the middle""? Or perhaps a more general term where the imbalance isn't just a single direction but requires handling both sides. But no, the key point is when both left and right subtrees are unbalanced, so multiple rotations are needed.

So, to sum up, the imbalances that require multiple rotations are when both the left and right subtree heights differ by more than one, necessitating two rotations: one on the left and another on the right, or something along those lines.

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when both the height difference between the left and right subtrees exceeds one. This situation necessitates adjusting the tree to balance at both levels simultaneously, leading to the need for two rotations.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Hmm, let's start by recalling what an AVL tree is. It's a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. That means it keeps balance automatically, right?

I remember that balanced trees like AVL and Red-Black Trees are crucial because they ensure operations like insertion, deletion, and search are efficient. In an unbalanced tree, say when we have a long chain of nodes where each new element is inserted into the left subtree, that can cause problems.

Wait, so if elements are added one by one to the left child until the height difference becomes two, then the right subtree would be taller by one. That's the initial state of an AVL tree. But what happens when it goes beyond that? Like if I have 12 nodes all in the left child path. At that point, inserting another node would make the heights differ by two again.

So, in that case, how do we rebalance? We need to perform rotations. A single rotation can fix this for one level of imbalance. For example, when a right-heavy tree is inserted after an insertion causes two levels off balance, a single rotation from the root down would fix it. But if I have multiple nodes off balance in the same path or different parts of the tree, more than one rotation might be needed.

Let me think about specific examples. Suppose I insert elements 12 times into the left subtree, which makes the height difference at that level two. Then, inserting another node would cause an imbalance again. To fix this, I'd have to rotate around each affected node starting from the root up until the point of imbalance.

But wait, in some cases, it might require only one rotation if multiple nodes are involved. For instance, if all off-balanced nodes are at different levels, maybe a single rotation can handle two or more imbalances. I'm trying to remember if there's an example where that happens. Maybe inserting elements that cause the tree to tilt in both directions? Or perhaps when you have three or four consecutive nodes that need correction.

So, putting it all together: the key is when multiple levels of imbalance occur on a single path from the root, requiring more than one rotation to balance. Each node along that path must be rotated until the tree is balanced again.

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when nodes are inserted or updated in such a way that the heights of two adjacent subtrees differ by more than one level on a single path from the root. This leads to multiple levels being unbalanced, necessitating rotations to restore balance.
