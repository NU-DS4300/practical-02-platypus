According to the context, there is no specific information provided about the release date of Redis. However, I can tell you that Redis is an open-source, in-memory data store that was first released in 2005.

As a Redis expert, I can also point out that the Redis Company (Redis Labs) maintains the official Python client library, redis-py, which is widely used for interacting with Redis databases from Python."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
