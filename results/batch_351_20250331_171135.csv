"According to the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle refers to the various states an EC2 instance can be in:

* Launch - When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
* Start/Stop - Temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
* Terminate - Permanently delete the instance.
* Reboot - Restart an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.

These states allow users to manage their EC2 instances effectively and efficiently."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"Based on the provided context, the answer to your query is:

The EC2 lifecycle involves four stages:

1. **Launch**: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.

These stages are mentioned in the context provided, specifically in the ""EC2 & Lambda.pdf"" documents (pages 1 and 4)."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
