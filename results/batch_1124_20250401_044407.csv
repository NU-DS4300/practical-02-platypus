Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. 

The first part talks about Neo4j from page 2 of Volume 10. It mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011 and it's a graph-based database system. That sounds important because it gives an exact year, which is what I'm looking for.

Then, on the same volume, pages 1-3 discuss various aspects of Neo4j. It mentions the goal as providing a visual way to match patterns and relationships in graphs, using Cypher. Also, there's a mention of APOC Plugins and other related software. However, none of these sections seem directly relevant to the invention date.

The next section is an introduction from Volume 09. It states that Neo4j was introduced as a graph-based database system supported by both transactional and analytical processing capabilities. Again, this doesn't mention any year.

On pages 20-21 of Volume 09, it elaborates on the features of Neo4j's data model and provides examples using Apache Spark and Neo4j. This is where I see references to ""Graph Algorithms - Practical Examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j,"" which were mentioned earlier as similar with a similarity score of 0.27.

Looking through all this, the key information about when Neo4j was created comes from Volume 10 on page 2, where it's stated that Neo4j was developed in 2011. That seems to be the most direct answer. The other sections discuss features and examples but don't provide any dates related to its invention.

So, putting this together, the answer should be that Neo4j was invented in 2011 based on the information provided in Volume 10 of the context.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. The user provided several documents and some context about Neo4j. Let me go through each document they gave and see if any mention the invention of the query language.

First, there are two PDF files on page 2: one from page 10 discussing Neo4j and another from page 20 about the graph data model. Both seem to talk about Neo4j as a graph database system, mentioning it was introduced in 2011. So that's definitely a point.

Then there are other PDFs like ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" pages 9-11, which also mention the introduction of Neo4j in 2011. The user even had an example query where they created users and connected them with edges. That query language part is about querying the graph data model, so perhaps this document explains the query language aspects.

Looking at other documents like ""Introduction to NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" page 4, it's talking about NoSQL as a database system that doesn't use SQL, but I don't see any information about Neo4j here. The query language part from the user is about Neo4j specifically.

So putting this together, Neo4j was introduced in 2011 and its graph query language became available there. All the documents provided point towards it being introduced that year.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, I see a PDF document titled ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" on page 2. In that file, it mentions that Neo4J is a graph database system created in 2011. The title says, ""Goal: SQL-equivalent language for graph databases,"" which makes sense because they want to provide a graph query language similar to SQL but designed specifically for graphs.

Then there's another document from page 15 of the same file, titled ""Basic Data Importing."" It shows how data is imported into Neo4J using Cypher. The code example uses CSV files with headers: 'id', 'title', and 'releaseYear'. That part doesn't directly answer the question about when Neo4J was invented.

Looking at other parts of the context, there's a document from page 0 titled ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf."" It describes Neo4J as a new class of no-sql databases that supports both transactional and analytical processing. The document also mentions it being relatively new, compared to Microsoft CosmoDB or Amazon Neptune, which were introduced later.

The answer provided earlier points out the year 2011 in one part of the context when Neo4J was created. However, I need to ensure that this is accurate based on the information given. Since only parts of the document are provided, and the key text is about the creation date being in 2011, it seems reliable.

I also notice mentions of other no-sql databases like CosmoDB or Neptune, which were introduced later than Neo4J. This might be relevant to understanding the evolution but not directly answer the question.

So, putting this all together, Neo4J's graph query language was invented in 2011.
