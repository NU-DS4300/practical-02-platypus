Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. The query is about determining that number.

Looking at the context given, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So that part clearly states there are 16 databases in total.

I don't see any other information in the context related to the number of databases. It's all about what Redis offers as default. Therefore, the answer should be 16.
</think>

Based on the context provided, Redis provides a default set of 16 databases. This is explicitly stated in the text:

""The document states that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15.""

Therefore, the number of databases Redis supports is **16**.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. They're numbered from 0 to 15. It also says there's no other name associated with them and that direct interaction with Redis is done through commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs. Additionally, it brings up similar information about 23 but I think that might be a typo or maybe another part of the document.

Wait, in the context provided, after ""There is no other name associated - Many language libraries available as well."" It says chunk Redis Database and Interaction, which seems to list some topics but doesn't specify the number. The answer mentions 16 databases, so I should focus on that information.

So, based on the context, Redis supports 16 databases numbered from 0 to 15. That's pretty straightforward. Even though there might be more details about interaction commands or other libraries in the text, the question is specifically asking for the total number of supported databases, which is 16.

Based on the provided context, Redis supports a total of 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15.

It says there's no other name associated with them and it talks about direct interaction commands related to k/v pairs and language libraries available as well. So, the number is 16.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything else. The context mentions ""Direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs (and variations)"", which are probably the standard operations like push, pop, etc., but that doesn't affect the count of supported databases. It also says there's no other name associated, so each number from 0-15 is separate. Therefore, Redis supports 16 databases in total.
</think>

Redis provides a default set of 16 databases numbered from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers corresponds to a distinct database instance within Redis.
