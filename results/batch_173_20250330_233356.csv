Okay, so I need to figure out how many data types Redis supports for holding values and list them all. From the context provided, it looks like there's a lot of information about Redis in various PDFs and documentation. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, on page 19, it mentions that Redis typically uses keys and values. The specific data types they're talking about are strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which can be unordered or ordered?), sorted sets, hashes (which are like JSON objects but represented as strings), and geospatial data with similarity scores.

Then on page 17, it says Redis is mainly a KV store but can be used with other models. It mentions various database types like KV stores, graphs, spatial databases, full-text search, vectors, time series, etc., each having their own value types. But for the query, I'm focusing only on values.

Looking at page 22, it explains that Redis provides 16 databases by default and directly supports commands for setting and getting k/v pairs or variations. It doesn't go into lists of commands but instead says it's a KV store primarily with other models available.

In the same document (page 23), under ""The next slides are not meant to be an exhaustive list,"" they mention that while Redis has commands for sets, lists, hashes, etc., there isn't a complete list here. It then references a documentation link which I don't have the content of yet.

Then on page 18, it states that Redis is in-memory and can handle durability by saving snapshots or appending-only files which are journals for roll-forward. It also mentions Redis supports lookup by key only since there are no secondary indexes, and it's efficient with up to 100,000 operations per second.

So compiling this information: values in Redis support strings, lists (which can be ordered), sets (ordered and unordered?), sorted sets, hashes (represented as JSON objects but stored as strings). Additionally, there are other database models like graphs and vectors that also use Redis for their value types, which aren't mentioned here. Since the query is about values, I should only list what's directly discussed.

I think that's all the data types mentioned in the context related to values in Redis.
</think>

Redis supports several data types for holding values. The primary ones are:

1. **Strings**: For simple type checking and manipulation.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Ordered collections of elements.
3. **Sets**: Unordered sets, which can be either unique or non-unique.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Order-sensitive sets with no duplicates.
5. **Hashes (JSON Objects)**: Storing objects as JSON strings.

Additional database models using Redis also support various data types, but these are not part of the query focus on values.

Okay, I need to figure out how many data types Redis supports for their values and list them all. Let me go through the context step by step.

First, in one section about Redis DB, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. They're numbered from 0 to 15. But the answer only lists 8 of them: 'kdb64', 'hset64', 'hsol72', etc., up to 'vdb32'. Wait, that's only 8 types, not all 16.

Then in another section under Redis - It is considered an in-memory database system, but... they mention it supports durability of data. Durability means the database can be rolled forward if there's a failure, which makes sense for in-memory since you don't have backup files.

They also talk about Redis.py Documentation, listing some highlights, but nothing more detailed than that. The main points are clarity, simplicity, and speed. Speed is mentioned as 100,000 SET operations per second, which supports lookup by key only, not complex data structures like arrays or objects.

But the question specifically asks for data types supported for values. Redis's documentation doesn't mention any data types beyond their KV (key-value) model. They focus on structures and commands without listing specific data types.

Looking at other sources, in 'NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf' pages 19-20, it says the values are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. But Redis also supports a range of data types like integers, floats, dates, etc., but these aren't mentioned here.

So in my own knowledge, Redis primarily uses KV store with key-value pairs. They can handle various types: strings, numbers, booleans, dates, times, etc., and support lists, sets, hashes as well. However, the specific data types listed under 'Values' are only strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (functions), and geospatial.

Putting it all together, I should mention Redis supports key-value pairs with various types but don't list all of them because they're not specified in this context.

Redis primarily supports key-value pairs with a variety of data types. It can handle strings, numbers, booleans, dates, times, and other data types as values. The specific data types mentioned in the provided context are: strings, lists, sets (including sorted sets), hashes, and geospatial data. Redis does not support complex structures like arrays or objects in this context.

Answer: Redis supports key-value pairs with various data types including strings, integers, booleans, floats, dates, times, dates of the week, months, years, seconds, milliseconds, nanoseconds, nanoseconds since epoch, and geospatial data. It does not support complex structures beyond the KV store model as specified in the context."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what Redis supports as its data types based on the given context. Let me start by reading through each part carefully.

First, there's a paragraph about Redis in the NoSQL section, mentioning that it's an in-memory database system and supports durability. It says it saves snapshots or is append-only with a journal for roll-forward if something fails. But I don't see any data types mentioned here. Hmm, maybe that's covered elsewhere.

Then there's a section on Redis - it's considered an in-memory database but can be very fast. It mentions being C++-built and supports durability through snapshots or append-only with a journal. Again, no specific data types listed here.

Next, I see a paragraph about Redis commands on page 22. It lists some Redis commands like list, hash, set, etc., but it doesn't mention the data types. Each command might correspond to different data structures, which have specific values they can hold.

The other section is ""Redis + Python.pdf"", starting at page 3. Here, there's a list of Redis commands in Python. The user mentions using the documentation to find exact commands, but again, no direct mention of data types here.

Looking back, I see another paragraph on NoSQL that talks about values: - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets (unique unsorted string elements) - Sorted Sets - Geospatial data with similarity 133.24. This seems relevant because it clearly lists the possible value types for Redis in a NoSQL context.

Additionally, there's a paragraph that says Redis is considered an in-memory database but can be very fast and supports durability. This doesn't list any data types either.

So, putting this together, the most direct information about data types I have is from the NoSQL section where it mentions values: strings, lists (linked lists), sets, sorted sets, and geospatial data with a similarity score of 133.24. However, if I'm limited to the context provided without other sections, maybe I should focus on that.

I also notice a mention in the NoSQL section about commands like list, hash, set, etc., but these are more about operations rather than data types. The values section seems to be the key here.

The Redis database supports various value types based on the context provided:

1. **Strings**: These can contain any binary sequence of characters.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Each element in a list is unique, and there's no order, but elements are unsorted.
3. **Sets (Unique Unsorted String Elements)**: Elements are unique and unordered; however, they aren't sorted.
4. **Sorted Sets**: These allow sets to be ordered, making insertion and searching efficient.
5. **Geospatial Data**: Represents geographical information, including a similarity score of 133.24.

Additionally, Redis in the NoSQL context mentions durability through snapshots or append-only operations but doesn't list data types explicitly."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
