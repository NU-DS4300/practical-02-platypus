Okay, I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced and operations like insertion, deletion, and search have logarithmic time complexity.

Imbalances in an AVL tree occur when the balance condition is violated. The main types I know are when a node's right subtree is taller than its left subtree by two or more units (right-left imbalance), which causes a single rotation to fix. Another common issue is when a node has both a left and right subtree that is taller, meaning the tree is ""squeezed"" between two nodes with the same height, requiring two rotations.

Wait, but isn't there also something called a 'double rotation' where you need more than one step to rebalance? Maybe I should think about specific examples. If during an insertion or deletion, the tree becomes unbalanced because of uneven heights, which type of imbalance would require multiple rotations?

Let me consider when an AVL tree can't balance after inserting or deleting. For instance, if we have a node that has too many nodes on one side, it might cause right-left imbalance, requiring a single rotation. On the other hand, if the insertion leads to both the left and right subtrees being unbalanced, you might need two rotations: first fix the left subtree's height by rotating up or down, then adjust for the right subtree.

But I'm not sure if there are cases where more than two rotations are needed. Maybe in some complex scenarios? Let me think about a case where multiple nodes are involved. For example, if you have a root node with both left and right children that are deep, requiring each to be balanced, perhaps leading to needing multiple rotations for the tree's height.

Alternatively, I remember something called 'double rotation' where two specific cases require two rotations: one where the left subtree is unbalanced and another where the right subtree is unbalanced. But sometimes, you might need more than that? Or maybe in a more complex scenario like when both subtrees are deeply balanced but their heights differ by two.

Wait, I think there's an example where inserting a node causes the tree to have two levels of imbalance, meaning one on each side. This would require two rotations: first fix the left subtree's height and then adjust for the right, or vice versa. That makes sense because each rotation can fix only one level of imbalance.

I'm not sure if I've heard about a scenario that requires more than two rotations. Maybe in some very specific cases? Or perhaps when the tree is being rebalanced after multiple operations, but that seems less likely since each insertion or deletion affects at most three levels, which would require up to two rotations.

So, putting it all together, imbalances that require multiple rotations in an AVL tree are typically those where either one subtree is significantly taller than the other (right-left imbalance) requiring a single rotation, or both subtrees have equal height but are missing nodes on each side, necessitating two rotations. There's no commonly known scenario with more than two rotations needed because inserting into the middle of a balanced tree can't cause an imbalance that requires more than two.

I think I'm confident now that the types of imbalances requiring multiple rotations are either right-left imbalance or subtrees missing nodes on both sides, each necessitating one or two rotations respectively. So, in summary, it's when the tree is unbalanced and needs to be rebalanced by rotating at least two levels up.
</think>

The imbalances that require multiple rotations in an AVL tree are primarily categorized as follows:

1. **Right-Left Imbalance**: This occurs when one subtree is significantly taller than the other (difference of two or more units). A single rotation can correct this imbalance.

2. **Subtrees Missing Nodes on Both Sides**: If both left and right subtrees have equal heights but are missing nodes, a second rotation is needed to rebalance the tree.

No commonly known scenarios require more than two rotations in an AVL tree due to its structural constraints and balancing mechanism.

Alright, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This property ensures that operations like insertion, deletion, and search remain efficient with time complexity O(log n). But if it's not balanced, the tree can become skewed, leading to imbalances.

When an AVL tree becomes unbalanced, either left or right subtree is taller than the other by more than one level. I think this is called a ""height imbalance."" Now, how does that cause multiple rotations?

I remember that when a node is inserted and causes the tree to have a certain balance condition violated, we perform rotations to rebalance it. Let's break it down step by step.

First, during insertion or deletion, if the tree becomes unbalanced due to an imbalance in height, either the left subtree of a node is taller than the right, or vice versa. Suppose the left side is too tall (left rotation required).

In such cases, we have two possibilities: either the node on the insertion point has one child that's out of order, requiring a single rotation. But if both sides are out of order, meaning neither left nor right rotations can fix the issue, then we might need multiple steps.

Wait, so for example, if after inserting a new node, the tree becomes unbalanced due to both left and right imbalances, how do we fix it? Do we rotate nodes in layers?

Let me think about an example. Suppose I have two nodes on the same path leading up to the root. If one is missing or has an incorrect value, that might create a situation where multiple rotations are needed.

Alternatively, if after inserting a new node, both left and right subtrees become unbalanced by one level each in opposite directions, we might need to rotate once from the insertion point towards the deeper tree and then again towards the other side. That would take two rotations.

But how do these rotations exactly work? Let me visualize an AVL tree. If I have a node with two children where the left child is too low (like missing) and the right child is too high, that could be an imbalance on one side but not necessarily both. Wait, no—if inserting into a leaf causes the root to adjust by moving up or down?

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of specific tree structures.

Suppose I have a node with left child that's too low and right child is balanced. Then when inserting, if one subtree becomes unbalanced, we do a single rotation from there. But if both subtrees are problematic on opposite sides, perhaps two rotations are needed.

Alternatively, maybe it's not the number of subtrees but the direction of imbalance. For example, if the left subtree is too high and the right is missing data, you rotate the insertion node to bring down the left subtree first. If that doesn't fix it, then you need to perform another rotation on the root or elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should consider specific cases. Let's take an example where after inserting a node, both the left and right subtrees of a particular node are missing data.

So, for instance, imagine inserting into position 7 in a perfect tree (so all levels except last have full nodes). The root would then have two children: one on the left that's too low, and one on the right which is balanced. But if both subtrees are problematic on opposite sides, perhaps we need multiple rotations.

Wait, no, if inserting into position 7 in a perfect tree (like in C# using ArrayInsert in LINQ), when you do it, the root would have two children where only one is low. Wait, but actually, when you insert in the middle of a fully populated binary search tree, the root remains balanced because adding an element doesn't cause any subtree to be too high.

But perhaps in other cases? Let me think about inserting into a leaf node. Suppose I insert a new value that causes the insertion point to exist at a leaf. Then, when the root is updated, it might shift up or down based on data order.

Wait, but when you insert into a leaf, the tree becomes unbalanced because now one side has more nodes than the other by one. So in this case, only one rotation would be needed to rebalance it.

But what if inserting causes both left and right subtrees to become unbalanced? Let's say I have an AVL tree with two children on different levels. After inserting a new node that makes both subtrees too imbalanced.

Wait, let me take a specific example: Suppose the root has a left child that is missing data (left is empty) but the right subtree is properly balanced. Then when inserting into position 7 in a perfect tree, perhaps causing an imbalance.

But no, wait—if I insert into position 7 in a perfect binary search tree of height 3, it would actually cause the root to shift up to accommodate new data, which should still keep the balance.

Wait, maybe if you have two imbalanced subtrees on opposite sides. For example, inserting into a node where both the left and right children are unbalanced because one is missing data and another has incorrect order.

But in an AVL tree, each insertion point can only lead to a specific structure change. So perhaps it's not that complex.

Wait, actually, I think the key here is understanding what causes multiple rotations when balancing an AVL tree.

When inserting into a node where both the left and right subtrees are problematic, meaning both have more than one level of imbalance in opposite directions. For example, if after insertion, the left subtree is too high (has more nodes) by one level, but the right subtree is also too high. But that's not possible because the tree can only adjust once.

Wait, maybe when inserting into a position where both the left and right subtrees are missing data or have incorrect values, leading to two imbalances on opposite sides.

So perhaps in such cases, you need to perform rotations from multiple insertion nodes or root upwards.

Alternatively, consider a scenario where after inserting into a node, the inserted node is part of both an over-inferred low and high subtree. That might require moving up through several levels, each time needing a rotation.

Wait, maybe I should think about tree rotations in terms of degrees of imbalances. For example, if the left subtree is too deep by one level, we do a single rotation from there. If both the left and right subtrees are problematic but on opposite sides, perhaps two separate rotations are needed.

But how would that work? Let's say I have an AVL tree where the root has a left child that's missing data, which makes the left subtree too high by one level, and a right child that's correct. Then inserting into this node might cause both subtrees to be unbalanced in opposite directions—left subtree becomes too high, but if the insertion is not at the leaf, perhaps it affects another level.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of an example where after inserting, you need two rotations because one rotation would fix the left side, and then another rotation would fix the right side.

So in this case, each rotation corrects one imbalanced subtree. Therefore, if both subtrees are problematic on opposite sides, you need multiple rotations from different insertion points or levels up.

I think that's the gist of it: when an AVL tree has two imbalances on opposite sides after inserting or deleting a node, multiple rotations are needed to rebalance each imbalance.
</think>

An AVL tree is balanced using rotations. When an AVL tree has two imbalances on opposite sides (left and right subtrees), you need to perform separate rotations for each imbalance.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Imbalanced Subtree:**
   - Determine which subtree (left or right) is too deep by one level due to an insertion, deletion, or update operation.
   
2. **Perform a Rotation from the Root Upwards:**
   - From the root node upwards, perform rotations as needed. Each rotation corrects the imbalance in one direction.

3. **Handle Both Imbalance Cases:**
   - If both left and right subtrees are problematic on opposite sides:
     - Perform a separate rotation for each subtree to rebalance them individually.
   
4. **Resulting Balanced State:**
   - The tree is now balanced with all subtrees having equal height, ensuring optimal performance.

**Final Answer:**

When an AVL tree has two imbalances on opposite sides after insertion or deletion, multiple rotations are needed to correct each imbalance. Thus, separate rotations from different levels are performed as necessary.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This helps keep the tree balanced and ensures efficient operations.

I think about how imbalances can cause problems. If there's too much imbalance, like if one subtree is significantly taller than the other, then a single rotation might not be enough to rebalance the tree properly. Let me recall what rotations are. There are two types: left rotation and right rotation. A left rotation moves the right child of a node up to take its place, which can help reduce the height difference. Conversely, a right rotation does something similar but in reverse.

I remember that if an AVL tree has an imbalance that requires more than one rotation, it's either because there are two levels of imbalances or three levels down. For example, imagine a left-heavy subtree and no corresponding right-heavy counterpart nearby. Or maybe the height difference is too large beyond just one level. Let me think about specific examples.

I recall that if after an insertion, the tree becomes unbalanced in such a way that more than two nodes are unbalanced (like three levels deep), then a single rotation won't fix everything. So, you might need to perform multiple rotations or even a restructure operation like a splay or balance.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. If the tree is only unbalanced in one level and can be fixed with one rotation, that's manageable. But if it's deeper, then more rotations are needed. So, when you have imbalances beyond two levels, multiple rotations are required to rebalance.

I think the key here is ""multiple levels"" of imbalance causing multiple rotations. This makes sense because each rotation can only fix a specific part of the tree, not all of them at once.
</think>

The question asks about imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations. I recalled that imbalances cause issues by differing heights beyond one level. Specifically, when there are three or more levels of imbalance, a single rotation isn't enough; multiple rotations or restructuring operations like splay are needed.

**Answer:** Imbalances in an AVL tree requiring multiple rotations occur when the tree is unbalanced at two or more levels (three or four nodes deep). This necessitates performing multiple rotations to rebalance."|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
