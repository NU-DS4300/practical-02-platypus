Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query about the data types supported by Redis for values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and its data types.

From the context provided, it mentions that in page 19 of a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" there are details about Redis Data Types Keys. The keys listed include:
- Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial data with similarity 0.31

The context also says that the values for these keys are as follows:
- Strings
- Lists (which are arrays, so they can hold multiple elements)
- Sets (they contain unique elements, which might be similar to objects in other languages)
- Sorted Sets (sorted collections of unique elements)
- Geospatial data with a similarity score of 0.31

Now, the query is asking specifically about the data types supported by Redis for values. I need to determine if Redis only supports certain types based on this context.

Looking at the key-value pairs:
- The value ""Strings"" corresponds to strings in Redis.
- ""Lists"" corresponds to arrays (lists) in other languages like JavaScript, Python, etc., which are collections of items.
- ""Sets"" typically correspond to sets or unique elements without order, but I'm not entirely sure if this is accurate because the context mentions that they're unsorted. However, in Redis, a set is a type of sequence where elements can be duplicated and are stored in a way similar to arrays.
- ""Sorted Sets"" would mean ordered collections of unique strings.
- ""Geospatial data with similarity 0.31"" refers to geospatial types like geometry or coordinates.

Given this information, the supported values for Redis's data types keys include:
- Strings
- Lists (arrays)
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial data

The context does mention that Redis supports these sets but doesn't specify if it only includes them. It also lists several examples of geospatial data, which aligns with the idea that Redis has a geospatial data type.

However, I should consider whether there are other types mentioned in the key-value pairs. The query is about values, not keys. So while the keys have certain values associated with them, the query is specifically asking for the values supported by Redis data types. 

In some databases or languages, you might see names that resemble these keys but refer to different data types. For example, in JavaScript, a Set is similar to a Redis set but not exactly the same. However, in many other contexts, when they say ""set,"" they mean something like a key-value store where each value is unique and can be inserted only once.

But based on the context provided, it seems that the values are:
- Strings
- Lists (arrays)
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial data with similarity 0.31

I don't see any mention of other types like dictionaries or objects in Redis. So I think those might be beyond the scope of this question.

Therefore, putting it all together, the data types supported by Redis for values are strings, lists (arrays), sorted sets, and geospatial data with a similarity score of 0.31.

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- Strings
- Lists (arrays)
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial data with a similarity score of 0.31

These correspond to the keys listed in the provided context, where the associated values are as mentioned."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user has given a query that asks me to name the data types supported by Redis for values. They also provided a context that talks about Redis Data Types Keys, but I'm not entirely sure how it relates. 

Wait, the context mentions specific details about Redis data types, like strings, lists, sets, etc., and their values. The query is straightforward: they want me to list those types supported for values. So, using the information from the context should be enough.

I need to make sure I'm not overcomplicating it. The context mentions that values can be strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, or hashes. Each of these has specific properties. For example, a list is a sequence of elements, and each element must be hashable. So Redis allows for unsorted lists.

I should structure the answer clearly listing each data type and its possible value types as per the context. That way, the user gets all the necessary information without any confusion.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- **Strings**: Any binary sequence.
- **Lists**: A sequence of elements where each element must be hashable.
- **Sets**: Unique unsorted string elements (no duplicates).
- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but sorted, allowing duplicates if the set was unsorted.
- **Hashes**: String â†’ string transformations."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, I need to answer the query about the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context. Let me read through it again.

The context mentions that Redis supports several data types for its values. It lists them as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes, each with specific details. So the main point is to identify these types.

I should make sure to include all supported types: strings, list, set, sorted set, and hash. Also, mention that geospatial data has similarity statistics but isn't a direct value type here.
</think>

The context states that Redis supports several data types for its values, which are:

- **Strings**: These can be any binary sequence.
- **Lists**: This is a linked list structure where each element points to the next one.
- **Sets**: These contain unique elements and can be unsorted.
- **Sorted Sets**: These maintain elements in a sorted order.
- **Hashes**: These map keys to values, such as strings.

Additionally, Redis supports geospatial data with similarity statistics but not directly as value types. 

**Answer:** Redis supports the following data types for values:
- Strings
- Lists
- Sets (unsorted)
- Sorted Sets
- Hashes"|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
