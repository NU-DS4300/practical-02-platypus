Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for holding values. From the context provided, there are a few important points about this. Let me start by reading through the information carefully.

First, in page 19 of ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" it mentions that Redis has different data types. It says they can be strings or any binary sequence and gives examples like values being strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, etc. But wait, what specific data types are mentioned? The context doesn't list them explicitly, just describes the possible types. So maybe I need to infer based on standard Redis knowledge.

Then, in page 5 of ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" there are some string commands examples. They show how to set values using mset(), retrieve them with mget(), increment them with incr(), and print out the results. This tells me that Redis can handle strings but also more complex structures like lists, sets, hashes, and geospatial data.

Looking at page 12, it mentions ""context 13"" which likely refers back to the earlier content about values being different types. So maybe the main point here is to list all possible values Redis supports for these operations.

I also see a link on page 14 that's about using Redis with Mlops in ML (Machine Learning) viaMadewithML.com. This might be relevant because it talks about feature stores, which are collections of features. I remember that in ML, feature stores can store structured data, and Redis is often used for this.

So putting this together, the key points are:
1. Redis supports strings as values.
2. It also supports other structures like lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, etc., depending on what you need to store.
3. These operations are demonstrated in the Python examples given, showing how to set, retrieve, and increment values.

I think it's important to note that while Redis can handle these various data types, there might be performance considerations when dealing with large datasets or complex structures because of how they're managed. But for the purpose of this query, I need to list them out as specified.

Redis supports a variety of data types for holding values, which are categorized based on their nature and use cases:

1. **Strings**: Simple text or characters that can be used directly in operations.
2. **List**: A collection of elements where each element is a string. Lists allow you to store multiple items together.
3. **Set**: An unordered collection of unique strings, which ensures no duplicates are stored.
4. **Sorted Set**: Similar to a set but maintains the order of insertion for ordered data.
5. **Hash**: Used for storing key-value pairs where keys can be any binary sequence (strings, numbers) and values can also be any binary sequence. Hashes are efficient for lookups.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Redis supports geospatial data types such as GeoJSON, allowing for precise location-based information.

These structures make Redis flexible and powerful for a wide range of applications, including feature stores in machine learning where complex data can be organized efficiently."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, I need to figure out which data types Redis supports for values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. From what I remember, Redis is primarily a key-value store, but it can also support other models like graphs and sets.

Looking at the context provided, there are mentions of various datasets in different files. The first file from page 19 talks about Redis Data Types Keys: strings, lists, sets, etc. It gives examples for values as well, including binary sequences.

The next section on pages 5-6 shows some commands where they use Redis objects and perform operations like mget, mset, rpush, lrange, incr, etc. These commands suggest that Redis can handle more than just key-value pairs. They mention functions for sets, lists, and sorted sets, which I think refers to the data structures in DS/ML.

In page 14, there's a link to feature-form.com/post/feature-stores-explained-the-three-common-architectures that talks about different models like geospatial and full text search. This indicates Redis can be used with other models as well.

Additionally, the section on pages 5-6 using Redis commands for key-value operations and list manipulations shows that there are functions beyond just getting and setting keys. They also mention hash and geospatial data support similarity metrics, which adds to the versatility of Redis.

The last part in the context links Redis with Python through madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/, which is relevant for ML and feature stores. This further supports that Redis can be integrated with other tools, possibly supporting different types of data structures.

Putting it all together, Redis supports a range of data types including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, binary sequences, geospatial data, and even functions like mset, rpush, lrange. The commands provided in the context demonstrate these functionalities.

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

1. **Strings**: Both raw strings and binary sequences.
2. **Lists**: Implemented as linked lists (both regular and sorted).
3. **Sets**: Unique unsorted string elements; can be represented with or without duplicates, though sets in Redis are typically unordered.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Ordered sets of unique strings.
5. **Hashes**: Mapped from keys to values, supporting complex data structures through functions like mset and rpush.
6. **Binary Sequences**: Data types that hold binary sequences, often used for geospatial information or other sequence-based data.

These functionalities are supported across various models within Redis, including key-value stores, sets, graphs, and spatial databases, making it versatile for different data modeling needs."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. I remember that Redis is an in-memory database, and it uses a model called ""key-value pairs."" From the context provided, especially the PDFs, there are several sections discussing different aspects of Redis.

First, looking at page 19, it mentions that Redis Data Types Keys are usually strings but can be any binary sequence. Values include strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which have unique elements and are unordered), sorted sets (sorted by insertion order), hashes (which map keys to values where both key and value are strings), and geospatial data with similarity. 

But the query is specifically about the data types supported for values, not the keys. So I should focus on the Value section. It also mentions that Redis supports many language libraries, which might include functions for handling these data types.

Additionally, in another part of the context, there's a section about ""Redis in DS/ML"" where it talks about using Redis as a feature store and provides some examples. The example given uses mset and rget with keys and values, and later uses hset and hgetall for more complex data structures like hashes.

Putting this together, the primary value types Redis supports are strings, lists (which can be unsorted), sets (which are unordered but have unique elements), sorted sets (ordered by insertion), and geospatial data with similarity. There's also mention of supporting many libraries that handle these types, which suggests that there might be other supported data types or more advanced functions.

I should make sure I'm not missing anything else. The other sections talk about the client commands for setting, getting, incrementing, etc., which relate to the key-value pairs but don't directly describe the value types beyond what's already been mentioned in the Value section.

So, compiling this information, Redis supports a wide range of value types including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. It also allows for many programming language libraries to handle these data types seamlessly.

Redis supports several key-value pairs where the values can be various data types. Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Strings**: The primary value type, which includes any binary sequence.

2. **Lists**: These are unsorted linked lists that can contain duplicate elements.

3. **Sets**: Unique and unordered collections of strings, each appearing only once.

4. **Sorted Sets**: Ordered based on insertion order, with unique elements.

5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Mapped keys to values where both key and value are strings, supporting case sensitivity and complex lookups.

6. **Geospatial Data**: Supports similarity calculations for geospatial data pairs.

7. **Many Language Libraries**: Redis also integrates with various programming languages through libraries like Ml4R, expanding the range of supported functions and operations.

In summary, Redis's value types are extensive, covering strings, lists, sets, hashes, and geospatial data, all within its KV store model."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
