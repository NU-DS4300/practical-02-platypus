Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports as values based on the context provided. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, in the NoSQL Intro chapter, it mentions that Redis is primarily a KV store but can be used with other models. It also lists some specific data types: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are string to string mappings), and geospatial data. So I'll note those down.

Then, looking at the Redis Database section from db-engines.com, it says Redis has 16 default databases, numbered 0 to 15, each being a KV store or similar. It doesn't mention more complex types beyond the basic ones identified in the first context.

The Python docs also list Redis-specific commands, but they don't include any data types beyond what's mentioned in the first part about lists, sets, etc. They seem focused on functions and operations that require these specific structures.

I think I've covered all the relevant information from each section. The key data types Redis supports are strings, lists (which can be mutable or unsorted), sets (which are unique and unsorted), sorted sets, hashes (key-value pairs), and geospatial data with similarity. These are the main ones discussed in the context provided.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

1. **Strings**: Used to store text data.
2. **Lists**: A collection of items that can be modified.
3. **Sets**: Stores unique elements without duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but ensures elements are in order.
5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Maps keys to values, typically strings.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Represents geographic information with similarity metrics.

These data types are fundamental to Redis's operation as a KV store and can be enhanced with additional features as needed."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values. Looking at the context provided, it seems that the query is about understanding Redis' value support. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, in the NoSQL Intro document, they mention Redis as a KV store but also note it's an in-memory database with durability features. Durability means data can be saved to disk or rolled over if there's a failure. The context here mentions strings can be any binary sequence and others like lists, sets, etc., are supported.

In the next section about databases, Redis is categorized as a KV store but also allows other structures like graphs. It says it primarily uses KV stores for operations that require key-value pairs, which makes sense because its value types support many of those operations efficiently with in-memory data.

The third source from NoSQL Intro mentions Redis can handle various models like geospatial, time series, vector, etc., but the specific point about the value types is still the same: strings are supported. It also lists other structures, not just KV, so I should focus on values here.

Looking at the Python documentation link, they list a command list and highlight Redis-specific commands for handling different data structures. The important part is the list of possible values: strings, lists (which can be any sequence), sets (unique sequences), sorted sets (sets with unique elements that maintain insertion order), hashes (key-value pairs where keys are from a set and values are also from the same set), and geospatial data.

The document on durability features emphasizes handling data efficiently by saving snapshots or appending-only files, which reinforces Redis's capability to manage multiple versions of data if needed. However, this doesn't change the value types it supports; it just ensures data is robust against failures.

In the NoSQL Intro document, the section on value support explicitly states that Redis primarily works with strings but also supports other sequences like lists and sets. The mention of Key-Value pairs in the KV store context doesn't affect the value type options because the values are the main focus when selecting a data structure for operations.

So, combining all this information: Redis can handle various binary sequences including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (as key-value pairs), and geospatial data. It's designed to manage these efficiently with its durability features in mind.
</think>

Redis supports several types of values which include:

- **Strings**: The primary type for key-value operations due to the flexibility it offers.

- **List**: Represents an ordered collection of elements, supporting insertion at any position and efficient iteration.

- **Set**: A collection of unique elements that maintain uniqueness by returning a warning on duplicates.

- **Sorted Set**: Similar to set but maintains insertion order, making operations like insertion, membership checking, and traversal efficient.

- **Hash**: Supports key-value pairs where both keys and values are from the same sequence. This structure is useful for many algorithms requiring such relationships.

Additionally, Redis handles geospatial data with similarity scores of 0.17, indicating support for data that includes geographic information alongside other attributes.

**Answer:**
Redis supports strings, lists (arrays), sets, sorted sets, hashes (key-value pairs), and geospatial data structures."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, let's tackle this query about the data types supported by Redis for storing values. I remember that Redis is often compared to a KV store because it primarily stores key-value pairs, but it does have some other features.

First, from the context provided, the user mentioned Redis as an Open Source in-memory database and discussed its use cases like graphs, spatial data, etc. However, when looking at the provided documents, I found that Redis primarily supports a KV store model. But there are mentions of different types of databases within Redis, like Redis DB, which can be used for more complex data structures.

Looking into the context, specifically the part about Redis Database and Interaction, it talks about various data structures like sets, hashes, and sorted sets. These seem to fit with a primary key-value storage but also support other in-memory databases. The document lists Redis as providing 16 default databases by number (0-15), each targeting different data structures.

Additionally, the context mentions that Redis supports durability through snapshots or append-only operations, which is useful for data persistence. But it's clear that while Redis isn't designed for complex data storage like JSON arrays or objects, it can handle certain types of data efficiently with commands related to key-value pairs.

Putting this together, Redis does support various data types as values in its primary model by using keys, but it also acts as a versatile database supporting different structures. However, the main focus is on its KV store capabilities.
</think>

Redis primarily supports a primary key-value (KV) store model for storing values. In addition to basic key-value pairs, Redis can support other data types through its various in-memory databases or commands. For example:

1. **Sets**: These are unsorted sets that allow duplicate entries.
2. **Hashes**: These can be used as key-value storage where the value is a string or another hashable type.
3. **Sorted Sets and Sorted Lists**: These support ordered data structures, which can be useful for maintaining sorted lists of items.

These features make Redis suitable for tasks requiring efficient lookups but also providing some level of in-memory complexity beyond its primary KV model."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
