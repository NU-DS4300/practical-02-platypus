Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query about the data types supported by Redis for values. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, there's a paragraph about Redis as an in-memory database system with durability features. It mentions that Redis supports various data models and their specific commands. The section on ""NoSQL Data Types"" refers to keys used elsewhere, which are strings or any binary sequences. These can be stored anywhere but for lookups by key.

Then, there's a part discussing Redis being open-source, in-memory, and sometimes called a data structure store. It talks about it primarily supporting K/V stores (key-value pairs) with various models like graphs, spatial, full text search, vectors, time series, etc., which adds complexity to its operations.

The user also mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, each with no other associated names except their own. Direct interaction is through commands related to setting and getting K/V pairs or variations, and it lists several libraries for use.

The section on ""Database Interaction"" states that Redis uses a set of commands to manage k/v pairs, often referred to as the Redis API, which is maintained by the company. It also mentions that in Python, Redis can be used through pip, specifically via redis.

Putting this together, I should identify all data types for values. From the first paragraph, keys are strings or any binary sequence. The ""NoSQL Data Types"" section lists several, including Strings, Lists (which is an array), Sets, Sorted Sets, and Hashes, which are functions from strings to strings. 

The later part of the text discusses various models that Redis can support beyond K/V, but since the query is about values, I focus on the key points related to values: keys in a database context. So, the primary data types for values (keys) are Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, and Hashes.

I should structure this information clearly, listing each data type with its details from the provided context.

The Redis data model supports several data types for values, which are primarily keys in a database context. Here's an organized presentation of these data types based on the provided context:

1. **Strings**: The most common data type, used for identifiers or labels in databases.

2. **Lists (Array)**: Similar to arrays, supporting unsorted elements where each element is a value.

3. **Sets**: Unique, unsorted strings that store distinct values; can be stored on disk for durability.

4. **Sorted Sets**: A specialized set type that maintains its contents in sorted order, useful for ordered data.

5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Maps keys to values, with keys typically being strings but can also be any binary sequence.

These key points are highlighted within the context of Redis's value types and their applications."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out which data types Redis supports for values based on this context. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, I see there are several sections about Redis as an in-memory database system. The query mentions ""data types supported by Redis for values,"" so I should look into where it specifically talks about data types.

Looking at the context, I notice a section starting with ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 19, chunk Redis Data Types Keys:..."" This part lists several key points. It mentions that Redis supports various data types like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data.

Wait, the query is about values, not keys, so I need to focus on data types as values. So, from the first chunk, it says:

- Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets (ordered sets)
- Hashes (strings → strings)
- Geospatial data

Then there's a later chunk that talks about the primary model of Redis as a KV store but mentions other models like graphs, spatial, etc., with specific commands. However, it doesn't directly address values in those other models.

I don't see any mention of other language libraries mentioned earlier in the context. The focus is on the main functionality and data types.

So, putting this together, Redis primarily supports strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data for values. There are no other specific language libraries discussed that would affect this answer.

Redis primarily supports the following data types for values:

- Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets (ordered sets)
- Hashes (strings → strings)
- Geospatial data

The primary focus is on these key data types, as outlined in the context."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for values. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, in the NoSQL introduction section, there's a chunk about Redis Data Types Keys. It lists several types like strings, lists, sets, etc., but it doesn't mention any values they can hold beyond these keys. So I think from this part, I know that the primary data types for values are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data.

Then there's a section about Redis DB, which mentions KV stores, graphs, spatial, full text search, vectors, and time series. But these are more advanced models, not value types per se, so maybe I don't need to include those in the answer for values.

Looking at the Python section, there are examples using string commands like mset and mget. The data being stored here is likely strings because that's what the example commands deal with. So if the data source name is ""data.grip"" or something similar, it might store JSON or other types as values, but since I'm focusing on Redis-specific value types, I should stick to what the context clearly mentions.

The query is about naming data types supported for values in Redis. From the provided context, I can extract that Redis supports strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. The geospatial part is more about how data is represented but isn't a value type itself.

So putting it all together, the data types Redis supports for values are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- Strings
- Lists (indexed collections)
- Sets (unsorted unique elements)
- Sorted Sets (ordered indexed collections)
- Hashes (key-value pairs)

These values allow Redis to store various data structures efficiently, suitable for in-memory operations."|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
