"Based on the provided context from page 13 of ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" with a similarity score of 0.48, I can answer your query as follows:

In an AVL tree, multiple rotations are required when there is a right-left or left-right imbalance, which occurs when the height difference between the left and right subtrees at a node is more than one. This type of imbalance requires two consecutive rotations: first a rotation to balance the left subtree, and then another rotation to balance the right subtree.

So, to answer your question, multiple rotations are required in an AVL tree to correct right-left or left-right imbalances."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"Based on the provided context from page 13 of ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"", I can answer your query accurately.

According to the context, it is mentioned that AVL trees require single or double rotations to maintain balance. In other words, imbalances in an AVL tree typically require only a single rotation or at most a double rotation, but not multiple rotations.

So, my answer would be: ""Imbalances in an AVL tree do not typically require multiple rotations; instead, they usually need a single or double rotation to restore the balanced property."""|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

"Based on the provided context from ""Introduction to Graph Data Model"" (page 13), I found the relevant information about AVL trees.

According to the context, an AVL tree requires multiple rotations when there is a ""longest path imbalance"". This occurs when one subtree has a height difference of more than 1 from its counterpart. In such cases, not just one rotation is enough to balance the tree; instead, multiple rotations are required to restore the AVL tree's self-balancing property.

So, the correct answer is: An AVL tree requires multiple rotations due to longest path imbalance."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
