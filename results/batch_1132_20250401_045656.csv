"Based on the provided context, I found a relevant chunk of text from page 1 of ""Redis + Python.pdf"" that mentions Redis-py, which is the standard client for Python and is maintained by the Redis Company itself. The text also mentions installing Redis using pip install redis in the 4300 Conda Environment.

According to this context, there isn't a direct mention of when Redis was released. However, since Redis-py is the standard client for Python, I can infer that Redis has been around long enough to have a dedicated client library written in Python.

If you're looking for information on when Redis was actually released, I don't know based on this context alone. You may want to explore other sources or documentation provided by the Redis Company or its community."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|320|32|10|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
