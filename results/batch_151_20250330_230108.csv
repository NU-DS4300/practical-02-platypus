Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. Each is numbered from 0 to 15, but there's no specific name associated with them beyond their numbering. That seems straightforward.

The question is just asking for the number of supported databases, not their names or anything else. So I can confidently say that Redis supports a total of 16 databases.

Redis provides 16 default databases, each numbered from 0 to 15. These are simply referred to by their numeric index but do not carry specific identifiers beyond this range.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me read through it again.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. They're numbered from 0 to 15. There's no additional naming beyond those numbers. So, each number corresponds to a separate database instance available in Redis. 

So, if the default is 16, that means Redis supports all numbers from 0 up to 15. That makes it total of sixteen databases.

Redis supports a total of sixteen databases by default, numbered 0 through 15.

Answer: Redis supports sixteen databases."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let's start by reading the context carefully.

The context mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It also states that there are no other names associated with these databases and refers to them as ""k/v pairs."" The context doesn't mention any additional libraries or versions beyond the 16 mentioned, so I can conclude that Redis supports exactly 16 databases in its default setup.
