Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. The user provided a context that mentions several things, including the year ""2011 - Goal: SQL-equivalent language for graph databases."" That sounds like the year they're referring to.

The query is asking about the invention date of neo4j's graph query language. Based on the context, it seems that Neo4j was created in 2011 with a goal to have a graph query language similar to SQL but optimized for graphs. The context also mentions that APOC Plugin provides hundreds of procedures and functions, which suggests that Neo4j is indeed an open-source project.

So putting this together, the answer should be 2011.

Alright, so I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j. It's a graph database tool, right? And it has this query language that allows you to interact with your data in a more structured and efficient way compared to traditional databases.

The user provided a context from a document titled ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf,"" which seems to be a PDF about the history of Neo4j. It mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011 as part of the Cypher language, which is its graph query language. The document also talks about how Neo4j's goal is to provide a SQL-equivalent language for graph databases.

Looking at the context, it says: ""Cypher - Neo4jâ€™s graph query language created in 2011."" So that directly tells me that Cypher was introduced in 2011. But wait, the user asked when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Since I'm assuming Cypher is the query language, then it was invented in 2011.

I should make sure there isn't any other information or context suggesting a different year. The document doesn't mention anything about other languages or plugins for Neo4j beyond Cypher and related features. So yes, the answer should be 2011.
</think>

The graph query language introduced in Neo4j was Cypher, which was created in **2011**.

Answer: Cypher, invented in 2011."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, there seems to be a document titled ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" which talks about the history of Neo4j and its graph query language. The document mentions that it was created in 2011 with the goal of creating a SQL-equivalent language for graph databases. It also notes that Cypher is used to match patterns and relationships between nodes.

Looking at the answer provided, it correctly states that Neo4j's graph query language was invented around 2011. The context mentions that Cypher (the query language) was developed in 2011, so the answer aligns with that information. 

The user has provided a query asking when neo4j's graph query language was invented and an answer that correctly references the year from the context. Since the answer matches the context exactly, it seems accurate. However, if I were to make sure without referring back to the document, I would still look for mentions of Cypher or Neo4j in 2011 where these terms are used. There's no other information provided that suggests a different year was used.

Therefore, my conclusion is that the answer correctly identifies the year as 2011 based on the context given.
