Okay, so the user is asking about when Redis was released. I remember that Redis has been around for a while now. Let me think... yeah, I think it's been around since at least 2015 or early 2016. They mentioned a document in the context where Redis is described as an in-memory database with KV store capabilities and some specific models like Graph and Time Series. The query they're asking about is related to its release date, so I need to connect that to when it was actually released.

Wait, in the context provided, there's nothing directly mentioning Redis's release year. It just talks about it being an open-source KV store with various use cases and ranking in engine engines. So based on this information alone, I can't pinpoint the exact year it was released. The answer should acknowledge that more information is needed.

I should make sure my answer is clear and informative for someone who might not be familiar with Redis's details. I'll mention that while there's no direct link to release date from the provided context, other sources will provide that info. That way, the user knows that if they have access to more information or look into specific documents about Redis, they can get a better answer.

I don't think I need to go into any technical details like version numbers unless asked. The main point is just to state what's known and mention that more info is needed beyond the given context.

The context provided does not explicitly mention when Redis was released. However, from the document linked in the context (noSQL intro + KV DBs.pdf) on page 17, it describes Redis as a remote directory server or data structure store, primarily used for KV storage but applicable to other models. While there's no release date mentioned in this context alone, more information about Redis' history would be needed.

Answer: Redis was released over time, and while the document does not provide a specific year, it describes its use as an open-source KV store with various applications. For the exact release date, additional sources or information are required beyond the provided context."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let me start by thinking about the information given in the context.

In the context, there's a paragraph that talks about Redis and Open Source, specifically mentioning it as a KV store. It also mentions Redis being an Open Source project with some specifics like Primarily a KV store but used with other models such as Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, and Time Series. Additionally, it references db-engines.com for the ranking of KV stores.

The query is asking when Redis was released. Hmm, I don't see any information about Redis in that context. It only discusses its role and types of databases and other related projects like Open Source initiatives or ranking systems.

I know from general knowledge that Redis has been around since 2006. The official release date is August 19th, 2006. However, the context provided doesn't provide this information because it's not in the list of details given. It just mentions Redis as an Open Source KV store and points out other projects.

So, considering that the query is about Redis's release date but the context only gives info on its role and database type, I think there's no way to accurately answer when Redis was released based on the provided information. The correct release date should be mentioned in a separate context or more detailed section.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The context mentions a document titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" and points to page 17 of that file. The paragraph talks about Redis as an Open Source, In-Memory Database with various models like KV store, Graph, Spatial, etc. It also includes some ranking information: Redis has a ranking of 18 from db-engines.com, and the similarity is 249.79.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure how ""ranking"" and ""similarity"" are relevant here. They might indicate some sort of popularity or performance metric, but I don't see any dates mentioned in this context. The only time-related information provided is when Redis was discussed, which seems to be around the end of 2023.

Since there's no direct mention of a release date for Redis from the given context, I can't find an answer based on the information provided. However, if I were to make a guess based on common knowledge, I might assume that Redis was released in early 2024. But without concrete dates or other relevant info, this is just an educated guess.

I don't have any specific information about when Redis was released from the context provided. If it's around early 2024, that could be a reasonable assumption based on general knowledge of similar open-source databases."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
