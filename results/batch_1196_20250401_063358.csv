Alright, I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Let me look through the context provided.

First, I see that there are two PDF documents in the context. The first one is from page 2 of ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf."" It mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011. That's a key point here because it directly answers the query about when neo4j's graph query language was invented.

I don't need to look at the other PDFs unless they provide additional information, but since both documents mention Neo4j's creation date and similarities with other systems like CosmoDB, I can be confident that 2011 is correct. The other documents seem to talk about Neo4j's features and its applications in Spark and graph algorithms, which are related but not directly relevant to the question.

So, putting it all together, the answer is straightforward: Neo4J was invented in 2011.

The query asks when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Upon reviewing the context provided, I found that ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4jâ€™s graph query language created in 2011."" This directly states that Neo4J's graph query language was invented in 2011. The other documents discuss the system's features but do not provide additional information on when Neo4J itself was invented.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by reading through the context provided and see if any of it mentions Neo4j specifically.

Looking at the first part, there's a section about Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - from 2011. It says they were created in 2011. Then later, there are other documents discussing Neo4j, like its introduction to graph data models and its use with tools like Spark and Docker. 

I also see that the context mentions other materials similar to Neo4j, such as Microsoft CosmoDB and Amazon Neptune, but they don't specify when those were created.

The query provided is about when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. The context doesn't explicitly state when Neo4j itself was introduced for graph queries; it just mentions the time periods where various components of Neo4j were developed or used. So based on the given text, the earliest mentioned introduction to Neo4j's graph query language is in 2011.

Wait, but I'm not sure if there are any other references that might clarify this. The user provided multiple sources with different times: some say 2011, others mention CosmoDB and Neptune introduced later. But since the context doesn't directly address Neo4j's introduction time for its query language, I think the most accurate answer is 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language was introduced in **2011**."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. 

The user gave a lot of documents and specific page chunks about Neo4j. From the first chunk on page 2, it says that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011 with the goal of making it SQL-equivalent for graph databases. So that seems like the year when the language was introduced.

I also see references to other documents, like from page 2 of 09-Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf and others, but those don't directly answer the query about when Neo4j invented its graph query language. The key point is in the first paragraph where it clearly states the year as 2011.

I should make sure that the context doesn't mention any other years related to this topic. It's straightforward here; Neo4j was created in 2011, which makes sense given the goal mentioned earlier about being SQL-equivalent. 

So, putting it all together, the answer is 2011 when Neo4j's graph query language was invented.
</think>

Neo4j's graph query language was invented in **2011**. The document mentions that Neo4j was created to provide a SQL-equivalent for graph databases and had the goal of making it suitable for both transactional and analytical processing.
