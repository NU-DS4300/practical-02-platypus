Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what an AVL tree is. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, and operations like insertion, deletion, and searching are efficient because they take O(log n) time.

In a standard AVL tree, when inserting or deleting data, if the balance factor (the difference in heights between the left and right subtree) becomes two, the tree is considered unbalanced. At this point, rotations are necessary to rebalance the tree. The key thing here is that an AVL tree requires at least one rotation—either a single left rotation, a single right rotation, or maybe multiple if there's more imbalance.

I remember that when inserting a new node causes the tree to become too unbalanced on one side (height difference of two), we perform a single rotation. But wait, isn't it possible for an insertion to cause two different sides to become imbalanced? For example, left might be higher by two and right might also be higher by two. In that case, both rotations would need to happen.

Let me think about an example. Suppose I have a root node with a right subtree of height 2. If I insert a new node in the left subtree somewhere, it could cause the right side to become too tall again, requiring another rotation on the left. So, each insertion can potentially require one or two rotations.

I also recall that some data structures like splay trees and Treap allow for multiple rotations during balancing because they handle more complex cases where both sides might need correction. But in a standard AVL tree, it's typically just a single rotation when inserting causes the imbalance on one side. However, if inserting results in two different imbalances, you have to do two rotations.

Wait, but isn't an AVL tree always balanced by at least one rotation? Or can there be cases where more than one is needed? For instance, when inserting might cause both left and right subtrees to become unbalanced. So, each insertion could require either one or two rotations depending on the situation.

I think I've seen a case where an insertion causes two imbalances, so you have to perform two rotations—one for each side. That would make it more complex but still manageable because the tree remains balanced by the end.

So, to sum up, in an AVL tree, when inserting or deleting data and the balance factor exceeds one, the tree requires at least one rotation. However, if both left and right subtrees become unbalanced (height difference of two), then two rotations are needed—one for each side. This makes it necessary to have multiple rotations but ensuring that the tree remains balanced.
</think>

In an AVL tree, when inserting or deleting data leads to a balance factor exceeding one, the following occurs:

1. **Single Rotation**: If only one side (left or right) becomes unbalanced, one rotation is sufficient to rebalance the tree.

2. **Two Rotations**: When both sides become unbalanced (each having a height difference of two), two rotations are required—one for each subtree—to correct their balance and maintain overall AVL properties.

Thus, an AVL tree requires at least one rotation but may need up to two when balancing occurs on both sides.

**Answer:** In an AVL tree, multiple rotations can be required if both left and right subtrees become unbalanced after insertion or deletion."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations to fix. Let's see... I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one for every node. So it's designed to keep the tree balanced, which helps with operations like insertion and deletion because they have logarithmic time complexity.

But sometimes, if the tree isn't perfectly balanced, we might get imbalances that cause issues. I think when a node becomes too heavy on one side, causing the height difference to exceed one, we need to rebalance the tree. So there are several ways the tree can become unbalanced, like uneven distribution of data or nodes becoming too deep.

From what I recall, the two main types of imbalances in an AVL tree are when a node has more than two children (overhang) and when a parent is deeper than its child. For example, if one subtree is much taller, that can cause problems because the tree might become unbalanced. 

I think when there's overhang, where a parent node has more left nodes than right ones, we need to perform rotations. So what exactly causes multiple rotations? I remember that this happens when a node becomes completely unbalanced after a previous operation. For instance, if inserting a new element creates an imbalance by having one side with two or more children and the other with none.

But wait, how does that lead to multiple rotations? Let me think... Suppose we have a right-heavy subtree. After inserting a new node, the right side becomes too deep. To rebalance, you might need to move nodes up from the right side to the left. But if the node needs to jump several levels higher, maybe moving nodes multiple times would fix it.

Alternatively, for overhang, when a parent has more nodes on its left than right, and after inserting or deleting, this difference becomes too large, you have to perform rotations both on the parent and the child nodes. So, each time you make an insertion that causes an imbalance, especially at higher levels of the tree, it might require multiple rotation steps.

I think in some cases, like when a node has three children, moving all left siblings up one level requires two rotations for just balancing that particular node. But I'm not entirely sure. I should probably double-check with my notes or some examples to make sure.

Looking back at the context provided, it mentions things like horizontal scaling, replication lag, and acyclic vs cyclic graphs. Hmm, how does that relate? Well, imbalances in an AVL tree can lead to other issues in distributed systems where each node is a separate data structure, but that's probably not directly related here.

So, putting it all together: when there's overhang or imbalance due to unbalanced trees, multiple rotations are needed. The key points are either having more nodes on the left than right (overhang) or the height difference being too large after an operation. Each such imbalance requires moving nodes upwards, possibly causing both parent and child nodes to rotate in or out.
</think>

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur primarily when one side of a node is significantly taller than the other. This situation can arise from two main issues: overhang (when a parent has more left nodes than right) and imbalance due to height differences exceeding one. 

1. **Overhang**: When a node becomes completely unbalanced with more left children than right, multiple rotations are needed because each rotation moves data up the tree, potentially affecting higher levels. For instance, balancing three nodes requires two rotations.

2. **Height Imbalance**: If inserting or deleting causes one side to grow much taller than the other, additional rotations are required for both parent and child nodes to rebalance the tree.

In summary, multiple rotations fix imbalances by moving nodes up, addressing overhangs and height issues in an AVL tree."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause it to require multiple rotations to rebalance. Let me start by recalling what an AVL tree is. It's a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, and operations like search, insert, and delete have logarithmic time complexity.

An imbalance in an AVL tree occurs when this property isn't maintained after inserting or deleting a node. The imbalances can manifest in several forms: left-heavy, right-heavy, or skewed (either way). When an AVL tree is unbalanced due to such imbalances, rotations are necessary to restore the balance.

Let me think about each form:

1. **Left-skewed**: This happens when the right subtree of a node is taller than its left subtree by more than one level. For example, if after insertion, the right child is two levels deeper than the left. To fix this, we need to move nodes from the right child up to the parent.

2. **Right-skewed**: Similarly, this occurs when the left subtree of a node is taller by more than one level. The solution would involve moving nodes from the left child upwards.

3. **Balanced but unbalanced due to duplicate values or other issues**: In such cases, inserting a new value might cause an imbalance. For example, if two nodes have the same value and we insert a third. If it's not just duplicates, perhaps due to incorrect ordering when using certain operations, this could lead to imbalance.

Now, considering multiple rotations: these are necessary when the tree is significantly unbalanced in both directions. Each rotation can adjust one side of the imbalance while potentially causing another side to become unbalanced. This cascading effect continues until all imbalances are resolved.

Let me visualize an example. Suppose we have a node with two left children that are all balanced, but its right subtree has multiple levels more than the left. So, it's right-skewed beyond one level. To fix this, we might need to perform rotations on each child to bring the nodes up and rebalance.

But wait, in practice, when an AVL tree is unbalanced due to a large number of elements causing multiple imbalances, multiple rotations are required to balance everything. Each rotation fixes one imbalance but may create another, necessitating further adjustments until all imbalances are resolved.
</think>

To address the question about how multiple rotations are needed in an AVL tree for imbalances:

1. **Left-Skewed Imbalance**: When a node's right subtree is significantly taller than its left subtree by more than one level, the imbalance causes the root to rotate upwards to balance both subtrees.

2. **Right-Skewed Imbalance**: Conversely, when the left subtree is taller, the root moves down to rebalance the tree towards a balanced state.

3. **Balanced but Unbalanced Due to Duplicate Values**: Inserting a value that duplicates existing keys or incorrect values can cause an imbalance. In such cases, multiple rotations are needed to restore balance, each time adjusting one side while potentially causing another imbalance.

4. **Multiple Level Imbalances**: When the tree is heavily skewed in both directions, multiple levels of imbalances exist. Each rotation fixes a level of imbalance, and this process continues until all are balanced.

In conclusion, multiple rotations are necessary when an AVL tree has significant unbalance across its entire structure, requiring adjustments on each level to achieve balance."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
