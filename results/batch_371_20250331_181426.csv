Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values. From the context provided, there's a section about Redis Data Types Keys and Values. It mentions that the value can be a string, list (which is like linked lists), set (which is unique unsorted strings), sorted set (which keeps elements in order), hashes which map strings to strings, and geospatial data with a similarity score.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if all these are Redis-specific or just general data types. The context doesn't specify any particular database model, so maybe it's more about the structure of those values rather than their actual storage mechanisms in Redis itself.

The query is specifically asking for the data types supported by Redis for values. So, I think I should list each value and what they are. Let me go through each one:

1. String: That makes sense, since strings are a common type of value.
2. List: A linked list structure where elements are stored in order, but not necessarily unique. So that's another key point.
3. Set: Unsorted string elements and can have duplicates if needed. But the description says ""unique unsorted string elements,"" which might imply that sets can't have duplicates unless specified.
4. Sorted Set: Similar to set but keeps elements in a specific order, so they are usually unique by default.
5. Hash: Maps strings to other strings. I remember that many applications use hashes as keys or values, especially with things like UUIDs or IDs.
6. Geospatial Data 20: That's geospatial data with a similarity score of 0.31. So this would be specific types of geographic information stored along with their geographical details, perhaps using a similarity function to measure closeness.

I should make sure that I'm not mixing up any terms here. For example, does ""set"" in the context mean an actual data structure or just any collection? From what's written, it seems like it's referring more to the general idea of sets being unordered but unique, which is correct for Redis as well.

Also, regarding hashes and geospatial data, I should remember that geospatial information usually includes latitude and longitude, or other specific coordinates. The similarity score might be used in applications where proximity is important, like location-based services.

Wait, did the context mention anything about being NoSQL? Yes, it's part of a document on NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf. So maybe there are nuances specific to how Redis handles these types within a NoSQL environment, but I think the focus here is just on the data types and their properties, not the database model.

So putting it all together, the supported values in Redis would be: String, List, Set, Sorted Set, Hash (with string keys or values), and Geospatial Data 20. Each of these has specific characteristics as per the context provided.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. **String**: Represents text data.
2. **List**: A linked list where elements are stored in order, not necessarily unique.
3. **Set**: Contains unique unsorted string elements.
4. **Sorted Set**: Maintains ordered elements and typically contains unique strings.
5. **Hash**: Maps input values to output values, usually involving strings.
6. **Geospatial Data 20**: Specific geospatial information with a similarity score of 0.31, including latitude and longitude.

These types are designed to handle various data requirements efficiently in Redis."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out the data types supported by Redis for storing values. From what I remember, Redis uses its own set of data types to manage collections of data efficiently. The context provided mentions some specific types in a PDF document. Let me try to recall and list them out.

First, I know that one common type is strings because many databases handle strings well. But the PDF says that values can be ""usually strings but can be any binary sequence."" So maybe there's more than just strings?

I think about lists. Oh, right! Lists are another key type in Redis. They store an ordered collection of items, which makes sense for data structures like arrays or linked lists.

Next, sets are mentioned too. The PDF says they're unique and unsorted string elements. So that would be a way to store collections where duplicates aren't allowed, which is useful for certain types of databases or when you need quick lookups.

Hashes come next as Values, but wait, I'm not sure about their role in storage. They take strings to strings, so maybe they're used to create hashes internally for data? Not entirely clear on how Redis stores them, though.

There's also something called Sorted Sets. That sounds similar to a normal set but sorted, so you can access them by order. I think that's useful when you need ordered collections and have specific ordering requirements.

Wait, the PDF also talks about hashes and geospatial data 20. Does Redis handle geospatial data? Maybe they've added a specific type for that. So perhaps there are types like geospatial numbers or something similar for handling geometric data?

And then there's the concept of sets with similarity, which is a ratio between two values. I'm not entirely sure how this fits into storage as a separate type, but it might be part of the hash or other types.

I should also consider whether Redis has any other specific data types beyond strings, lists, sets, and hashes. Maybe there are others that aren't mentioned in the context but are standard in the NoSQL ecosystem. But based on the provided PDF section, these seem to cover the main ones.

So putting it all together, Redis supports several key data types for values: Strings, Lists, Sets (including Sorted Sets), Hashes, and maybe Geospatial Data 20. Each has its own structure and use cases.
</think>

Redis supports several key data types for storing values, including:

1. **Strings**: The usual type used in many databases due to their efficiency.

2. **Lists**: An ordered collection of items that can be accessed by index.

3. **Sets**: Store unique, unsorted string elements. Sorted Sets offer ordered access.

4. **Hashes**: Convert strings to other types like geospatial data 20 for geometric values.

5. **Geospatial Data 20**: Specialized type for handling geospatial information with similarity ratios.

These data types are designed to efficiently manage collections of data, supporting various use cases from databases to NoSQL databases and specific geospatial needs."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for their values. From the context provided, it mentions that Redis has several value types like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. But I'm not sure about all the specifics.

Wait, the context also talks about binary sequences as values, which means they can be any kind of binary data. So beyond just strings, there's a list type for linked lists and a set for unique elements without order. Oh, and there are sorted sets, but waitâ€”doesn't Redis actually use ordered sets? Or is that a myth?

Also, there's a hash type which maps strings to strings. Then it mentions geospatial data with similarity metrics like 436.20. I think the specific number might be part of a dataset or maybe an example.

So putting it all together, Redis supports strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and some geospatial types. But I should double-check if there are any other data types mentioned. The context stops at geospatial 436.20, so that's the last one they cover.

I remember sometimes in discussions about NoSQL or Redis, people talk about vectors for geocaching-like datasets, but maybe that's more common with MongoDB? So probably not included here.

Alright, I think that's all the data types Redis supports based on the context given.
</think>

Based on the provided context and analysis:

Redis supports several value types for its data structures. These include:

1. **Strings**: Any binary sequence of characters.
2. **List**: A linked list structure used to store sequences of elements, where each element is a pointer to another element in the list.
3. **Set**: A collection of unique elements that do not maintain order, though not necessarily sorted.
4. **Sorted Set**: A type of set that maintains its elements in a specific order, typically alphabetical or some other defined key order.
5. **Hash**: A data structure that maps keys to values and is useful for operations requiring fast lookups, such as string-to-string mappings.

Additionally, Redis supports geospatial data types with similarity metrics like 436.20, which are used for geocaching-like datasets or similar applications where spatial relationships are important.

These data types in Redis provide flexibility and efficiency for various use cases, including but not limited to text processing, web caching, and geospatial data management."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
