Alright, let me figure out how to answer this question. So the user is asking, ""How many databases does Redis support?"" And I have a lot of context about Redis from different sources. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the context provided, there are mentions of Redis providing 16 default databases by default when using certain languages like Python and PHP. That’s a solid starting point because that’s what the user is most likely asking about. So right off the bat, I can say Redis supports 16 default databases.

But wait, maybe there are more? The context doesn't mention anything else beyond that unless I look elsewhere. For example, in other sections like the NoSQL DBs.pdf or the Python document, it's just talking about their current state and uses but doesn’t specify additional databases they support. So from what's provided, 16 is the main number.

I should make sure there are no hidden details or specific areas I'm missing. The documents mention features like durability of data storage—append-only files or saving snapshots which don't change how many databases it supports. They also talk about in-memory systems and different model variations but again, those are details about the system rather than the number of databases.

Also, considering other languages like Java might have different numbers, but since the query is about Redis specifically, I should focus on that domain. The context seems to suggest that Redis isn't expanding into more databases beyond these 16 unless specified otherwise.

So putting it all together, Redis primarily supports 16 databases by default. There might be some future updates or additional models, but based on the provided context, that's the answer.

Okay, so the user is asking about how many databases Redis supports. I need to go through the provided context and see which information is relevant. 

First, looking at the context from page 22 of the document, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default, numbered 0 to 15. That's a clear number. Then on page 23, there's some additional info about Redis being used for different models like graph, spatial, etc., but that doesn't relate directly to the count of supported databases.

The other sections are about Redis in Python and MongoDB, which don't seem to be relevant unless I'm misunderstanding. From the context, the most direct information is the number 16, so I should include that. 

I need to make sure there's no conflicting or irrelevant info. The user is specifically asking about Redis databases, so the 16 default ones are the key point here.

Revisiting your query: how many databases does Redis support?

Looking through the context provided, it mentions ""Redis provides 16 databases by default."" This is clearly stating that Redis supports 16 in-memory database systems as part of its default setup.

The other sections discuss topics like Redis being used for different architectures ( KV store, graph, spatial, etc.), its Python client framework, and MongoDB. However, none of this information pertains directly to the number of databases Redis supports.

Therefore, the answer is:

Okay, let me figure out how to answer the query about how many databases Redis supports. I remember from the context provided that there's a section mentioning ""Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default."" So, that seems like a key point here.

Looking at the context again, under the Redis DB section, it says Redis (Remote Directory Server) supports 16 databases by default. It also lists them as numbered from 0 to 15. But I don't see any mention of other databases or variations mentioned beyond the 16 listed. 

So, based on what's given, Redis doesn't support more than 16 databases. The query is pretty straightforward: how many does it support? The answer would be 16.

I should make sure that I'm not missing anything else. The context doesn't mention any additional databases or specific variations, so I can confidently say the answer is 16.

The number of databases Redis supports is 16.
