Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let's start by reading through the context carefully.

The first section talks about Redis providing 16 default databases because of Redis's history as an in-memory database. It mentions that each is numbered from 0 to 15. That part seems pretty clear, so I think that's a key point. 

Looking further down, there are two other sections on Redis DB. One says it's an open-source, in-memory database primarily used for KV stores but can be extended with various models like graphs or text search. This makes me think it supports many models beyond just the basic KV store.

Then, another section from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf mentions that Redis-py is a standard client for Python and it's maintained by Redis itself. The context lists that Redis has 16 databases and also provides a GitHub repository and a Conda environment where you can install Redis in Python. This seems to reinforce the idea that Redis supports all of its default database numbers.

So putting it together, I think the answer is that Redis supports 16 databases because of its history as an in-memory database, even though it's versatile enough to be used with other models beyond just KV stores.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases due to its historical status as an in-memory database. While it primarily functions as a KV store, it can also support extended models such as graphs and text search. This versatility is supported by the Redis DB section which mentions this capability.

Answer: Redis supports 16 databases because it has been developed with that in mind, despite its traditional role as a KV store."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. From the context provided, there was a PDF section talking about Redis providing 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. That sounds like Redis itself is designed to work with multiple in-memory databases, not just one.

The next part of the query mentions Redis as an open-source NoSQL database. The document also said Redis supports various models like KV store and can handle graphs, spatial data, etc. But it specifically says it primarily acts as a KV (Key-Value) store but is versatile enough to be used with other models too.

The context also provided a PDF on using Python with Redis. It mentioned that Redis-py is the standard client for Python, which makes sense because Redis is open-source and designed for such use cases. The link for Redis/py was given as redis/redis-py, which I think is the repository where you can find more documentation.

So putting it together, Redis by itself has 16 databases running in memory. Additionally, there's a Python library called redis-py that allows developers to work with Redis directly from Python, but it doesn't add more databases beyond those 16. The other models like graph databases or vector spaces are handled using Redis APIs through the Redis API client, not as separate database components.

Therefore, the total number of databases Redis supports is 16.

Redis by itself supports 16 databases in its default configuration. These are primarily designed for in-memory KV stores but are versatile enough to handle various data models such as graphs, spatial data, and vector spaces. The additional Python library redis-py allows developers to work with Redis directly from Python without adding more databases beyond the 16 main ones.

Alright, let me figure out how to answer the query about how many databases Redis supports. First, I'll look at the context provided. The user gave a PDF on Redis and related topics, but I don't have the exact content here. However, I can rely on the chunks from those documents that are included.

Looking at the context, there's a section titled ""Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default."" This is a specific line stating Redis supports 16 databases. There's also mention of a ""Direct interaction with Redis is through a set of commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs,"" which refers to key-value storage systems, supporting various operations.

The other chunks talk about Redis being an in-memory database system that can be very fast, but it doesn't handle complex data well. However, the main query is about the number of databases Redis supports, so I'll focus on that part.

I also see a section from ""05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17, chunk Redis DB)"" which says: ""Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database - Sometimes called a data structure store - Primarily a KV store, but can be used with other models."" This doesn't directly answer the number of databases Redis supports, but it reinforces that Redis is known for supporting multiple types of databases.

Putting this together, the most accurate information I have is that Redis supports 16 databases by default. The context doesn't provide additional details about different database names or versions beyond that, so I can confidently say that Redis primarily supports 16 databases.
