"Based on the provided context, I can confidently answer that Redis supports the following data types for values:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)
6. Geospatial data

These data types are listed on page 19 of the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" document, which is relevant to the query."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
