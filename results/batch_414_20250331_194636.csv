Okay, so the user is asking when Redis was released. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. It's an in-memory database system that can be used as a KV store. From the context provided, there are some PDFs discussing Redis in different sections. 

In the first one from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, page 18, it mentions that Redis was developed initially in C++ and later moved to Ruby. The original work started around 2009, so by then it was a major language change. 

Then, looking at 06 - Redis + Python.pdf, the PDFs discuss Redis as a Python client. It also talks about its use in ML with MadewithML. So, this suggests that Redis has evolved beyond C++ and into other languages.

There's another PDF from the same section that mentions Redis being maintained by the company, which aligns with the first one where it was developed around 2009. It also provides a GitHub repository and sets up a conda environment with specific packages, like redis, which further indicates its current status as a popular library for Python.

Putting this together, Redis started development in 2009 before moving to Ruby, then became the standard client for Python as mentioned. Therefore, I can conclude that Redis was indeed released in 2009.

Redis was released in **2009**. It is a widely used in-memory database system that supports various operations like key-value stores and has been maintained by its creators, making it an established tool for both development and production environments."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, the user is asking about when Redis was released. I remember that Redis has a long history as an open-source project. From the context provided, I see that it's described as a ""NoSQL database system"" but primarily known for its in-memory capabilities. Looking through the sections, there's a mention of its origins starting around 2009 in C++. It also says it was developed by the Redis Company, which is now part of Amazon Web Services.

I should check if there are any specific years highlighted in the context. I see that it's listed as originally developed in 2009 and mentions it being maintained by the company itself, which was renamed to Redis Inc. in 2016. So the official release year is 2009.

Wait, but sometimes people refer to versions with specific years. The context lists Redis DB as Redis Remote Directory Server, which was introduced in a certain version. But I don't see a mention of release dates for specific versions here; it's more about general historical aspects and popularity.

The query is just ""When was Redis released?"" without specifying the version. So I should stick to the official year when Redis Inc. was launched. That would be 2009.

Redis was officially released in 2009 by the Redis Company, which later became part of Amazon Web Services (AWS)."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was first released. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. From the context provided, it seems like Redis is an in-memory database system that supports durability through snapshots or journaling for roll-forward operations. It's not a traditional key-value store but can be used with other models like graphs and full-text search.

Looking at the context, there are mentions of Redis being maintained by the Redis Company itself. One of the pieces of information is about it being in an open-source project called redis. Also, I see that Redis-py is mentioned as the Python client for Redis. That gives me some clue about its development and community support.

In one section, it says Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15, with no other names associated. This indicates that Redis was developed early on, perhaps in a mid-2009 timeframe since the document referenced mentions of C++ code in 2009.

I also noticed that there's a Docker setup section where it instructs to pull/Run the latest image from db-engines.com. That makes me think about how Redis has been regularly updated with new features and improvements, especially considering its durability aspects, which require efficient storage mechanisms.

Additionally, Redis-py is listed as a standard client for Python. The mention of Docker Desktop and pip install commands suggests that Redis has gained popularity in data science and machine learning communities because it's versatile across multiple programming languages and environments.

Putting this together, I can conclude that Redis was released around 2009, at least in the early versions before its development into an open-source project. It makes sense given the context about C++ code, Docker setup, and Python client libraries.
</think>

Redis was first released in early 2009. Prior to this, it had been developed as a C++ library but was later integrated into an open-source project called redis. The document also mentions Redis-py as its Python client implementation, further indicating its widespread adoption and continued evolution over time."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
