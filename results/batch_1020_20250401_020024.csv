"A question about AVL trees!

In an AVL tree, the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most one (this is known as the ""balance factor""). When this balance factor is not maintained, we need to perform rotations to restore the balance. There are two types of imbalances that require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-left imbalance**: This occurs when a node's left child has a left child of its own, and the height difference between the grandchild's children increases by more than one. To resolve this, we need to perform a right rotation on the grandchild, followed by a left rotation on the child.
2. **Right-right imbalance**: This occurs when a node's right child has a right child of its own, and the height difference between the grandchild's children increases by more than one. To resolve this, we need to perform a left rotation on the grandchild, followed by a right rotation on the child.

In both cases, multiple rotations are needed because each rotation only partially corrects the imbalance, and another rotation is required to fully restore the balance factor.

"I must say that the context provided doesn't seem directly related to the query about AVL trees and their rotations. However, I'll do my best to provide an answer based on my knowledge of data structures.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree with the property that the height of the left and right subtrees cannot differ by more than one for all nodes. This ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced after insertions or deletions, which is important for efficient searching.

In an AVL tree, multiple rotations are required in certain scenarios to maintain balance:

1. **Left-left rotation**: When a node is inserted on the left side of its parent, and its right child also has a left-heavy subtree (i.e., the height of the left subtree is more than one greater than the height of the right subtree), a double left rotation is necessary to balance the tree.
2. **Right-right rotation**: Conversely, when a node is inserted on the right side of its parent, and its left child also has a right-heavy subtree (i.e., the height of the right subtree is more than one greater than the height of the left subtree), a double right rotation is required.
3. **Left-right rotation**: When a node is inserted in such a way that it causes an imbalance between the left and right subtrees, a single rotation (either left or right) may not be sufficient to balance the tree. In this case, a combination of rotations (e.g., a left rotation followed by a right rotation) might be necessary.

These multiple rotations help maintain the balance property of the AVL tree, ensuring that search, insertion, and deletion operations remain efficient.

"A query that's not directly related to databases or AWS!

But, I'll answer it to the best of my ability.

In an AVL tree, there are two types of imbalances that require multiple rotations:

1. **Left-heavy imbalance**: When a node has a left child with a height greater than its right child by more than one level.
2. **Right-heavy imbalance**: When a node has a right child with a height greater than its left child by more than one level.

To restore balance, the AVL tree algorithm performs rotations to adjust the heights of the involved nodes. This process involves rotating nodes up or down the tree to maintain the balance property (i.e., the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees cannot exceed one).

Multiple rotations may be required when:

* A node is inserted or deleted, causing a chain reaction of imbalances throughout the tree.
* The imbalance is severe, requiring multiple rotations to restore balance.

In summary, multiple rotations are needed in an AVL tree when there's a significant imbalance that can't be corrected with a single rotation."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
