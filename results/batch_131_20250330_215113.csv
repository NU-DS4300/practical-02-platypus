Alright, let me try to figure out how to answer this query about the data types supported by Redis for values. I'm a bit new to Redis, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that Redis is an in-memory database system that's great for handling large datasets efficiently. The context provided gives me some information about Redis and its data structures. It mentions that Redis primarily serves as a KV store, but it can be used with other models like graphs or vectors. 

Looking at the sections from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, there's a chunk on Redis Data Types Keys. Here, it says:
- Values: Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets (sets with sorted order)
- Hashes (string → string)
- Geospatial data with similarity 0.17

So that's the key points from those sections about what Redis considers a value and its possible types.

Then, in another section, 06 - Redis + Python.pdf, it lists Redis Command List with commands related to KV pairs like Set, Keyed Vectors, etc. It also mentions durability aspects: snapshots or append-only files that can be rolled forward if there's a failure.

The initial part of the context mentions Redis as an in-memory database system but supports durability, which is covered under 06 - Redis + Python.pdf. It also says it doesn't handle complex data like full indexes; only supports lookup by key. This might affect how developers use Redis with more complex datasets.

Looking back at the initial query: ""Name the data types supported by Redis for values."" The context's first section on keys includes various data types, but I think that refers to the values in a KV store. Since Redis primarily functions as a KV store, perhaps the data types here are similar to what's used in a typical noSQL database.

But wait, Redis isn't just a KV store—it can also be part of larger systems with different models. However, the context doesn't mention it being used elsewhere except as a KV store. So, for values within a Redis KV context, I'm guessing that the data types would align with what's listed in the keys section.

So, putting this together, Redis supports strings, lists (which are sorted linked lists), sets, sorted sets, and hashes. These seem to be the primary data types used as values in its main function. The presence of geospatial data here might indicate that it can handle specific types like geographic coordinates but is more focused on general data types.

I should make sure not to overcomplicate things. Since Redis is often referred to as a KV store, the key points about its supported data types are what I need to focus on for the query.

Redis supports several data types that are primarily used in its main function of acting as aKV store. These include:

- **Strings**: Basic data type for text.
- **Lists (sorted linked lists)**: Useful for collections where order matters.
- **Sets**: Unordered unique elements, though they can be sorted in Redis 14+.
- **Sorted Sets**: Ordered sets, ideal for ordered data.
- **Hashes**: Represents key-value pairs as strings to other strings.

These types are foundational for relational databases but also note that Redis is versatile and can support more complex data models beyond KV stores."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out the data types supported by Redis for storing values. I remember that Redis is an in-memory database system and it's used for things like real-time applications because it's fast and doesn't require downtime. From what I've read before, Redis can handle different kinds of data efficiently.

Looking at the context provided, there are several PDF sections discussing Redis. On page 19, it mentions that values in Redis can be strings or lists. Lists are linked lists where each element is a string. Values can also be sets, which are unique collections of strings. There's also a point about sorted sets and hashes, which are mappings from strings to strings.

The PDFs on pages 21 and 23 talk about durability in Redis, which means data isn't lost but can be rolled over if there's a failure. This is important because it affects how data is stored and updated. The connection from DataGrip helps ensure the system works smoothly.

In page 5 of the same document, there are commands like r.keys(), r.values(), r.set(), r.get(), r.incr(). These show different operations like adding values to sets or incrementing counts in keys, which are common tasks when handling various data types.

I should make sure to list all possible data types Redis can handle. The basic ones seem to be strings because that's the primary type used for storing text and numbers. But from other parts of the document, I see lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. So, those are also supported but maybe considered more advanced or less common.

I think the answer should cover all possible data types Redis supports for values, both at a basic level (like strings) and at a more complex level (lists, sets). This way, it's comprehensive and covers everything mentioned in the context.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for storing values are primarily:

1. **Strings**: The fundamental type used for text and numeric storage.
2. **Lists**: A linked list of strings where each element can be added or removed dynamically.
3. **Sets**: Unique collection of strings, allowing insertion but not modification due to uniqueness constraints.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain a sorted order.
5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Mappings from keys to values using strings as keys and values.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Strings representing geolocation information with similarity metrics.
7. **Full Text Search**: Strings containing text content.
8. **Vector Storage**: Vectors of strings that can store collections in a compressed format.

 Redis's flexibility allows it to handle these types efficiently, making it suitable for various data needs."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports as values. From the context provided, I see a lot about Redis, which is an in-memory database system. The context talks about Redis Data Types and Keys, so that's probably where data types are discussed.

Looking at page 19, it mentions that strings are commonly used, but they can be any binary sequence. So, that’s one of the main data types. Next, I see a chunk about Key-value pairs in other systems, but in Redis, values themselves can be lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, or geospatial data. These are key data types.

Then, on page 18, it says Redis is an in-memory system but has durability features like snapshots or append-only files for roll-forward if something fails. It doesn't handle complex data and only supports lookup by keys, which I think means each key is unique. The document also mentions some commands from the Redis Python library, like mset and get, which are used for managing sets of values.

So putting it all together: strings can be any binary sequence, lists, sets (sorted or not), hashes with string values, and geospatial data. I should make sure to list these out as the supported data types.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- **Strings**: Any binary sequence.
- **List**: An ordered collection of items.
- **Set**: A collection of unique unordered items.
- **Sorted Set**: Similar to a set but maintains order.
- **Hashes**: Mappings from strings to strings.
- **Geospatial Data**: Geometric data, such as geographic coordinates.

These are the primary value types Redis supports in its KV store model."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
