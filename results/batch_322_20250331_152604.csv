Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j and its history.

First, Neo4j is a graph database that uses Cypher as its query language. From the context provided, I see that the document mentions several versions of Neo4j, like Neo4j-1.0, Neo4j-2.0, etc., up to Neo4j-3.5. In each version, they mention improvements and new features.

Looking at the context, one section is about Neo4j's Cypher query language development. It says that the goal was to create a graph query language similar to SQL for graphs. It also mentions an APOC Plugin, which I think stands for Apache Obsidian Procedures Optimization Cloud, a popular graph processing engine. Another part talks about graph data model support and ACID compliance.

Another section is titled ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf,"" which says Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing with various indexing options and ACID compliance. It also mentions supporting distributed computing.

Then there's a Docker Compose section mentioning that Neo4j was integrated into Docker Compose 4, but I'm not sure how that relates directly to the query language invented time.

The part about graph algorithms in Apache Spark and Neo4j is from Needham and hodler (2019), which doesn't provide specific dates for when Cypher or Neo4j's query language was created.

Wait, so looking back, each version of Neo4j has updates that include improvements to the query language. For example, in 2011, they introduced Cypher as a graph query language. So the Cypher itself was invented around 2011.

The section about adding APOC and graph data model with ACID compliance could indicate the timeline when those features were integrated into Neo4j. But since it's not directly mentioned in terms of invention, it might just be an enhancement that came after the language was created.

Therefore, the Cypher query language for Neo4j was invented around 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was introduced around 2011. 

**Answer:** The Cypher query language for Neo4j was invented in 2011."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me think about this step by step.

First, from the context provided, I see a document titled ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher."" It seems like this is a core part of Neo4j, which is a graph database system. The document mentions that it's a graph query language created in 2011. So, I remember from my studies that Neo4j was introduced around that time.

I also see other documents about Neo4j. For example, ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" talks about how Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data. It mentions ACID compliant support, which is a key feature of relational databases. This makes me think that the query language, Cypher or GraphQuery, was developed within this context.

Looking at another document, ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 3, chunk Neo4j in Docker Compose 4) with similarity 0.45,"" it doesn't directly provide information on when the graph query language was invented but reinforces that Neo4j is built around this Cypher syntax.

The other document mentions similar data models and supports distributed computing, which are important aspects of graph databases but again, not directly about the invention date of the query language.

Putting all these together, the most relevant part is ""From 2011 - Goal: SQL-equivalent language for graph databases - Provides a visual way of matching patterns and relationships (nodes)"" in the first document. This clearly states that Cypher was created in 2011, which means Neo4j's graph query language was invented around that time.

I don't see any conflicting information from other sources that mention a different year for when Cypher or Neo4j was developed. All the documents I've reviewed support the conclusion that Cypher was introduced in 2011.

The graph query language, known as Cypher, was invented by Neo4j in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided a context that includes information about Neo4j, which is a graph database system. The query language part seems specific, talking about Cypher, APOC Plug-in, and other graph-related features.

From the context, there's a section titled ""10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Cypher - Neo4jâ€™s graph query language created in 2011). That seems like the year when Cypher was introduced. The next paragraph mentions that Neo4j supports various graph data models and provides procedures for efficient graph algorithms. It also refers to Microsoft CosmoDB, Amazon Neptune, and others as similar systems.

Additionally, there's a mention of a graph database system from 2010 that supports a query language called Graph Query Language (GQL). The context doesn't specify the year for that, but it's clear that Neo4j was introduced in 2011. The subsequent paragraphs discuss how Neo4j has integrated APOC Plug-in and added features like graph data model support, various procedures, efficient algorithms, and distributed computing.

So putting this together, the query language Cypher was introduced in 2011 when Neo4j was created. This seems to be the year the graph query language was invented for Neo4j.

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was introduced in 2011 when Neo4j was first developed.
