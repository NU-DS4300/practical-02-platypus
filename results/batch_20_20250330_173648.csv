"I'm happy to help! However, I must say that the context you provided seems unrelated to the query about AVL trees.

To answer your question, in an AVL tree, imbalances can occur when the height of one subtree differs from the other by more than 1 level. This imbalance is typically addressed through rotations (either left or right) to restore balance and maintain the properties of the AVL tree.

There are two types of imbalances that require multiple rotations:

1. Left-left imbalance: When a node has two child nodes, both of which are also left-heavy. In this case, you would need to perform a sequence of left rotations to rebalance the tree.
2. Right-right imbalance: Conversely, when a node has two child nodes, both of which are also right-heavy. Here, you would need to perform a sequence of right rotations to restore balance.

In both cases, multiple rotations are required because a single rotation would not be enough to fully rebalance the tree.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. The balancing criterion is based on the heights of the left and right subtrees. There are two types of imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations:

1. Left-Left Imbalance: This occurs when the left child of a node has a height greater than its right child. To balance this, we need to perform a double rotation (RR or LL).
2. Right-Right Imbalance: This occurs when the right child of a node has a height greater than its left child. Again, to balance this, we need to perform a double rotation (LL or RR).

In both cases, multiple rotations are required to maintain the tree's balance property.

"I'm happy to help! However, I must say that the context you provided seems unrelated to the query about AVL trees. The context appears to be about NoSQL databases and transactions, whereas the query is about AVL trees.

If I had to answer this question based on my knowledge of data structures, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree with the property that the height of the left and right subtrees can differ at most by one. In general, only two types of imbalances are possible in an AVL tree:

1. Left-heavy: When the left subtree has more nodes than the right subtree.
2. Right-heavy: When the right subtree has more nodes than the left subtree.

In both cases, a single rotation (either left or right) would be sufficient to rebalance the tree and restore the balance property.

However, if the imbalance is more severe (e.g., the height of the left subtree is significantly greater than the height of the right subtree), multiple rotations may be required to rebalance the tree. This could involve a combination of left and right rotations to restore the balance property.
