Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for holding values. From the context provided, it mentions several types like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. But let me make sure about each one.

First, strings—these are just regular text or text-like values. They can be any alphanumeric characters or special symbols. Lists are collections of items where order doesn't matter, so it's like an array in programming terms. Sets are unordered collections without duplicates, which is useful for unique data storage.

Sorted sets are similar to lists but maintain order, which might be helpful for certain operations that require ordering. Hashes take strings as keys and return strings as values, often used for lookups or mapping operations. Geospatial data includes points, lines, polygons, etc., with geohash values for location-based information.

I should make sure each of these is correctly noted in the answer. Also, I recall that Redis supports collections like bags, which allow duplicates but don't sort them, and structures like tuples. But based on the context provided, the primary focus is on the types mentioned.

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

1. **Strings**: Any alphanumeric characters or special symbols.
2. **Lists**: Collections of items where order doesn't matter.
3. **Sets**: Unordered collections without duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to lists but maintain order.
5. **Hashes**: Maps strings as keys and return string values, often used for lookups.
6. **Geospatial Data 20 (geohash)**: Represents geohash values for location-based information.

These types are essential for managing different kinds of data efficiently in Redis."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what Redis supports as values. I remember that in the context provided from the PDF, there's a section about Redis Data Types Keys and Values. It mentions several key types like strings, lists, sets, etc., but it doesn't list them explicitly.

First, I'll try to recall if Redis has specific data types for certain structures or operations. From what I know, Redis uses arrays as a default type because they can hold multiple values. So maybe ""List"" is one of the supported values. 

Then there's ""Set,"" which can store unique elements without any order. That seems relevant since it's used in sets like keys or to ensure uniqueness.

""Hashes"" are mentioned for strings, but wait, that's actually a data type for storing JSON objects. I think that's because hashes (or objects) are often used as values for other types of data. So maybe the value is ""Hashes.""

Sorted Sets might be another point, but it's not listed here, so I'm not sure if that's part of the key-value pairs or just a property. 

""Space"" and ""Vector"" could also come into play depending on the structure they represent, like in some distributed systems.

Looking back at the PDF, there's mention of Keyed Hashes for JSON objects but it doesn't specify their value type beyond being strings or lists. So I think that might not be directly relevant unless we're talking about a JSON object itself.

Also, ""Binary"" data types are used for binary values like images, numbers, etc., which aren't covered here because they don't fall into the category of keys or sorted sets.

Putting it all together, the key-value pairs include strings, lists (List), sets (Set), hashes (Hashes), and perhaps other structures depending on how you use them. I'm not entirely sure about Sorted Sets and Space/Vectors but they are possible data types.

The Redis data type for values includes:

- **Strings**: Directly used as value types.
- **Lists**: Typically used as keys or to hold multiple values.
- **Sets**: Stores unique elements without order.
- **Hashes**: Supports storing JSON objects, though not directly part of the key-value pairs unless in a specific context.
- **Sorted Sets**: A possible data type for ordered elements within sets.

These are the primary value types supported by Redis."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what Redis supports for value types based on the context provided from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf."" The section mentioned that Redis has several data types including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. It also mentions geospatial data with similarity. 

Wait, the query is specifically asking to name the data types supported by Redis for values. So looking back at the context, it says: ""Values: - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets (unique unsorted string elements) - Sorted Sets - Hashes (string → string) - Geospatial data 20) with similarity 106.03""

But the query is asking for value types, not including geospatial data. So I should focus on strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. That makes sense because these are the primary types for holding values in Redis.

So putting it all together, the supported value types would be:
- Strings
- Lists (which are like arrays)
- Sets (which are unordered collections of unique elements)
- Sorted Sets (ordered collections with no duplicates)
- Hashes (which map strings to strings)

I think that covers the main ones. I don't recall Redis supporting geospatial data specifically in this context, but maybe if they did, it would have been mentioned under a different section.

The Redis data types for values are:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets (ordered collections with no duplicates)
5. Hashes (string → string)

These types allow for efficient storage and retrieval of various data structures, including geospatial data when applicable."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
