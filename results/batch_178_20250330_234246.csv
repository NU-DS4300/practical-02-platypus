Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. There are a few documents mentioned about Neo4j, specifically ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher"" and the ""A Graph Database System."" 

From the first document, I see that Neo4j introduced Cypher in 2011 as part of its graph query language. The second document from page 1 talks about how Neo4j is described as a NoSQL database system that supports both transactional and analytical processing with various indexing and ACID compliance. It also mentions that the same capabilities were found in other graph databases like Microsoft CosmoDB or Amazon Neptune, which had similar functionalities.

I remember learning that before Neo4j was introduced, there were separate systems for handling graphs. The introduction of Cypher is considered an innovation because it provides a visual way to match patterns and relationships in a graph structure. It's also noted that the same features are present in other graph databases like CosmoDB or Neptune 2.

So putting this together, Neo4j was introduced with Cypher in 2011, which serves as its graph query language.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, there are several documents and pages related to Neo4j. Let me go through them step by step.

First, looking at the page from ""Cypher - Neo4jâ€™s graph query language created in 2011."" That mentions that Cypher was first introduced in 2011. So Neo4j used Cypher as its query language back then.

Then there's a document titled ""A Graph Database System..."" from 2019, which talks about how Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing with ACID compliance and distributed computing. That doesn't seem directly related to the introduction of the query language itself but more about how it works as a database.

Another document from 2009 discusses Neo4j's graph data model and similarity scores, which again is more about its architecture than its query language.

The ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" from 2019 also elaborates on the graph model with various indexing techniques and ACID compliance. It seems similar to what I already know.

From ""DS 4300 Neo4j Mark Fontenot, PhD Northeastern University Material..."" mentions using Apache Spark and Neo4j for practical examples in a book. This is about how Neo4j integrates with other tools but doesn't mention the development of its query language itself.

Lastly, from another document, there's a section on graph algorithms in Apache Spark and Neo4j with a similarity score of 0.26. Again, it's more about integration than the origin of the query language.

Putting this together, the most relevant information is that Cypher was introduced in 2011, which is used as Neo4j's query language. The rest of the documents discuss how Neo4j works and integrates with other technologies but don't provide direct info on when its graph query language was created.

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was introduced in 2011.

Answer: Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was introduced in 2011."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so the user is asking when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, I remember that there are two main graphs mentioned: one from the 10th page about Neo4j and another from 09th about CosmoDB or Neptune. Both talk about Cypher as the graph query language. 

Wait, in the 10th page specifically, it says that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011, thanks to the APOLIC Plugin. That seems pretty clear. But I should double-check if other sources mention any later changes or updates.

Looking at the 09th page about the introduction to the graph data model, it mentions the ACID compliance and distributed computing but doesn't specify when Cypher was created beyond being mentioned in the context of the 10th page. 

Since the 10th page explicitly states that Neo4j's Cypher was developed in 2011 with APOLIC, I can confidently say that the query language was invented in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was invented in 2011. This was facilitated by the introduction of the APOLIC Plugin into Neo4j."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
