Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, I see a PDF about Redis and its databases. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, on page 22, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That seems straightforward. So that's 16 databases right there.

Then, on page 23, the text talks about how Redis supports various interactions with its k/v pairs. It mentions durability mechanisms like saving snapshots or being append-only. It also doesn't specify if these are in-memory or disk-based, but I think those points are more about how Redis functions rather than the number of databases it supports.

Moving to page 24, which is about Redis as a database engine with multiple models. It says Redis can be used for KV stores and others like Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, Time Series. But that doesn't change the fact that it's primarily designed as a KV store. So even though it supports other models, it still only supports 16 databases.

In the Python documentation linked in page 25, Redis-py is introduced as the standard client for Python. It mentions being maintained by Redis and includes some setup tips like setting the decode_responses=True parameter when connecting to Redis. This might be a separate feature of Redis but not relevant to its database support count.

So putting it all together: Redis provides 16 default databases. Even though it's used with other models, that number stays at 16.
</think>

Redis supports 16 default databases by default. These are referred to as ""db"" values ranging from 0 to 15. While Redis can be extended with additional models such as Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, and Time Series, its primary database support remains consistent at 16.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each section of the given context step by step.

First, in the NoSQL section at page 22, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So that's 16 different instances or connections available with Redis.

Then, on page 23, there's a section about Redis as an in-memory database system, which supports durability of data through snapshots and journaling. It mentions no secondary indexes, only lookup by key, and can handle up to 100,000 SET operations per second. This part doesn't directly relate to the number of databases it supports.

The NoSQL section continues on page 24, where Redis is classified as a KV store but also mentioned for other models like graph, spatial, etc. However, it doesn't specify how many databases Redis itself supports beyond the initial 16 in the main set.

In the Python context, starting at page 06, there's a section about connecting to Redis using the Redis-py library. It mentions that Redis-py is maintained by the Redis Company and requires a Docker container setup. The code example uses host 'localhost', port 6379, db=2, with decode_responses=True set. This isn't providing information on the number of databases Redis supports.

There's also a Conda Environment section stating it should be installed via pip install redis, which is used for connecting to Redis in Python. Again, this doesn't add more detail about the database count.

The overall context seems focused on Redis as a database and its Python client, not directly discussing the number of databases Redis itself supports beyond its default 16 instances.

So, considering all these sections, Redis provides 16 databases by default when using it through Docker containers. The other parts don't provide additional information about that count.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the section about Redis Database and Interaction in the NoSQL Intro PDF (page 22), it says that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That's a key point because it directly answers how many there are.

The other sections discuss Redis as an open-source in-memory database system with durability features like snapshots and append-only files. They also mention Redis DBs, which can be used for various data models including KV stores, graphs, spatial data, etc. However, the main query is about the number of supported databases, so I don't need to focus on the other functionalities.

Additionally, there's a section about Connecting to the Server in the NoSQL Intro PDF (page 2) where it explains how Redis can be connected using Python. It mentions importing redis and setting decode_responses=True for string conversion from bytes. While this is related to using Redis in Python with specific configurations, it doesn't change the count of supported databases.

So, combining all these points, Redis supports 16 default databases as mentioned in the first section.
</think>

Redis supports a total of 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. These are the primary KV store implementations within the Redis database ecosystem. The other functionalities and sections provided do not affect this number.
