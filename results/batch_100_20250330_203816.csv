Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. I have this context provided, but it seems a bit disorganized. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, there's a document from page 2 of 10 about Neo4j, which talks about the query language and plugins. It mentions that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011, so I can note that down as 2011.

Then, looking at another document from page 1, it's a comparison of Neo4j with Microsoft CosmoDB and Amazon Neptune. The similarity scores are 0.26 for Neo4j and 0.21 for CosmoDB and Neptune. Hmm, that might be useful if I want to compare Neo4j's graph query language with others in the same family.

Another document from page 2 of 09 is about an introduction to the graph data model. It mentions that Neo4j supports transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data, which is a key feature for its use in no-sql databases. The similarity score here is 0.30 when compared to another introduction document by Needham and Hodler from 2019.

There are also a couple of documents from page 0 that discuss practical examples using Apache Spark and Neo4j, but the details about their similarity scores aren't provided. I'm not sure how relevant those are for answering the query directly.

So, putting it together: The main source that tells me when Neo4j's graph query language was invented is the first document from page 2 of 10, which states that it was created in 2011. The other documents are either comparisons or examples but don't provide additional information on the invention date.

I need to make sure I'm accurate here. It says Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011, so the answer should be 2011.

Okay, so the user is asking when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Let me look through the context they provided to find any information about this.

Looking at the first part of the context, it mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011. That seems relevant because the user's query specifically asks about the origin of the graph query language. The context also talks about Neo4j as a graph database system, supporting both transactional and analytical processing with features like APOC plugins and similar functions.

The other documents mentioned, like ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf,"" don't seem directly relevant unless they provide additional context on Neo4j's history. The user didn't ask for any information about the data model or specific products but focused solely on when Neo4J was created with a graph query language.

So, putting it all together, the key point from the context is that Neo4j was created in 2011. That should be the answer the user is looking for.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Let me look through the provided context to find relevant information.

First, there are two documents mentioned: ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf"" and another document titled ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"". Both have chunks related to Neo4J, specifically discussing its graph query language and data model. 

In the first document (page 2), it says that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011. That seems like a solid point. However, I should check other sources for more confirmation or alternative viewpoints.

The second document from page 0 mentions similar information about Neo4J's creation year as 2011. It also refers to some tools related to graph algorithms and their ACID compliance. This adds confidence that 2011 is the correct year.

Additionally, there are documents referenced about Graph Algorithms in Apache Spark and Neo4j. These might not directly answer the query, but they could be contextually relevant if someone is looking into how Neoh4j uses these algorithms. However, since the query is specifically about when Neoh4j was created, that document isn't crucial for this answer.

I should also consider any other sources or documents provided in the context. For example, there's a section from page 10 mentioning the introduction of Neo4J and its graph data model, which supports both transactional and analytical processing. It doesn't talk about the graph query language creation date though.

So, combining all this information, it seems that Neo4j's graph query language was indeed invented in 2011 based on the provided context. The other documents might discuss broader aspects of Neoh4j but don't provide additional dates for its development.
