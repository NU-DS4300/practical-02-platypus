"According to the provided context (Redis Data Types Keys) and other Redis documentation, the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. **Strings**: A sequence of characters that can be any binary sequence.
2. **Lists** (linked lists): A list of strings or binary sequences.
3. **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements): An unordered set of unique strings.
4. **Sorted Sets**: A sorted set of strings, with scores assigned to each element.
5. **Hashes** (string → string): A mapping of strings to other strings.

These data types are used as values in Redis, along with Geospatial data which is a specialized type for storing geographic locations."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
