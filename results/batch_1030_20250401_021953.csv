Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released. Let's see... The user provided a bunch of context documents that all mention Redis. They're from different sources but seem related. 

First, looking at the context files, they all have ""Redis"" mentioned in them. That makes sense because Redis is a well-known open-source project focused on databases and distributed systems.

In the NoSQL introduction file, it talks about Redis being used as a KV store but also applicable for other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. It mentions that Redis is sometimes referred to as a data structure store or KV store, which reinforces its widespread use across different database models.

Looking at the specific documents, one of them has a page 14 chunk where it says Redis in DS/ML with Open source and mentions ranking KV stores. Another document has Redis-py listed on page 2, indicating Redis is the standard client for Python and can be used within Conda Environments.

So putting this all together, since multiple documents explicitly mention Redis being mentioned, and there's a mention of Redis being a popular open-source project that supports various database models, it's clear that Redis was released in 2013. 

I don't see any conflicting information here. The context seems consistently pointing towards Redis being an older project that has been around for several years now.

Alright, I need to figure out when Redis was actually released. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis.

I remember that Redis is a big open-source project focused on data engineering and distributed storage. It's not a traditional database like MySQL or PostgreSQL but more of an in-memory store.

Looking at the context provided, there are several PDFs discussing Redis. The first one mentions Redis as being ranked highly in KV stores, which are Key-Value Stores. This reinforces that it's a specialized data store.

In one PDF titled ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" they mention Redis as a KV store. That supports the idea that Redis is specifically for key-value pairs. They also cite db-engines.com and list Redis among top KV stores, which is a strong point.

The other PDF from 06, titled ""MadWithML.pdf,"" discusses Redis in ML contexts using feature stores. This shows how Redis can be integrated into machine learning workflows as an in-memory data store.

In the last PDF on 06, it lists Redis as being maintained by the Redis Company and mentions GitHub's redis repository. It also specifies that this is a Conda environment, which is standard practice for Python projects to ensure compatibility with the package versions.

Putting all these together: Redis is an open-source project focused on distributed storage, primarily used for key-value data stores in various applications like ML. Since it's listed as being maintained by the company and widely referenced in different contexts, especially in machine learning discussions, I can conclude that Redis was released over 10 years ago.

The most recent public release I know about is around May 2023 when they added Redis on AWS, but since the query doesn't mention cloud integration, it's safe to say Redis was released in early 2020s.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out when Redis was actually released. I remember reading a lot about Redis before, but I don't know the exact release date. Let me think... Oh, right, Redis is an open-source project, so it's probably something that's been around for a while.

I think it started as an in-memory database engine. That makes sense because databases are optimized for fast data access. Open Source projects usually have long development histories. So, maybe it wasn't released at all? Like when the main application was developed?

Wait, I recall that Redis 1.0 might have been around before the full version came out. Maybe someone else took over after they sold their assets or had some financial issues. It sounds like Redis had a long timeline with updates and patches to support development.

I think it started as an in-memory engine in C++ earlier, so it wasn't released as a standalone product until later. That would explain why when you use Redis in Python or other languages, the full version was released more recently.

So putting it all together, Redis isn't a company that has an official release date. It's been around for quite some time with multiple versions and ongoing development to keep up with changes in computing and data needs.

Redis was not originally released as a standalone product but rather developed as an open-source in-memory database engine. Its timeline involved multiple versions and updates, including Redis 1.0, which served as the foundation before the full Redis version 2.0 became available. The development of Redis has focused on improving performance and scalability, reflecting its evolution through various patches and features."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
