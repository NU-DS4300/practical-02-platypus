Alright, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language, also known as Cypher, was invented. From the context provided, there are some documents and papers mentioned about Neo4j. Let me read through them again.

First, on page 2 of ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher,"" it says that Neo4j was created in 2011 with a goal to create a graph query language similar to SQL but for graphs. It mentions that Cypher provides a visual way to match patterns and relationships through nodes, connections using :CONNECT_TO, and includes APOC Procedures and plugins.

Then, on page 1 of the same document, it talks about Neo4j as a new class of NoSQL DBs. It says it's relatively new, supports schema optimization, has various indexes, is ACID compliant, and can be distributed. The similarity score with Microsoft CosmoDB and Amazon Neptune is around 0.22.

There are other documents on graph data models, but they seem to focus more on how Neo4j works with Apache Spark rather than when it was invented itself. So, the key here is the first document about Cypher's goals.

Since the goal of creating Cypher was in 2011, that should be the year when Neo4j's graph query language was invented.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was invented in 2011. 

**Answer:** 
Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was created in 2011 with the goal of providing a visual and intuitive way to work with graph-based data."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. 

The context includes several documents from 2011 and 2019 about Neo4j. The first one is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011)"" which mentions that Neo4j was introduced with a cypher language created in 2011. 

Then there's another document from 2019 titled ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" where it references several documents and notes the similarity scores for different versions of Cypher, including 0.27, 0.32, etc. But this doesn't directly address when Neo4j's cypher was introduced.

Additionally, there are documents from Docker Compose in 2015 that discuss graph databases, but they don't provide information on the introduction date of Neo4j's cypher.

The other document is about NoSQL and Relational Databases, which doesn't seem relevant to the query about Neo4j's cypher introduction.

So, based on the provided context, the most accurate information is that Neo4j was introduced with its cypher language in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language (Cypher) was introduced in 2011."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4J.

From the context provided, I see that Neo4j is a graph database system. It was created in 2011. But wait, it also mentions that Cypher is the query language. The first paragraph talks about Neo4j's goals and its features like APOC plugins and the Graph Data Science plugin.

Hmm, so maybe Neo4j itself was introduced before it became a graph database? I think Node.js and MongoDB were the main databases back in 2011. They had their own query languages: MongoDB used something called Preglow or Postfix notation, and Node.js had something else too. So Neo4j must have been developed earlier than the actual graph database.

In the context, it also mentions that Cypher is the graph query language. I remember seeing some articles where people use Cypher with Neo4j for querying data. Maybe this indicates that Cypher was the tool they used to write queries in Neo4j.

So putting it all together, Neo4j was introduced much earlier than 2011. It must have been developed before Node.js and MongoDB came out as main graph databases. The actual name ""Neo4j"" likely came later, maybe in 2020 or around that time. But the query language Cypher for Neo4j probably started way back.

I should also think about what happened between the introduction of relational databases and then moving to NoSQL. There were a lot of tools developed during that time—like graph databases like Neo4j, HBase, GraphDB, etc.—but their own query languages might have been part of their development history as well.

So yeah, the answer is probably that Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented much earlier than 2011. It must be from when Node.js and MongoDB were still in use.
</think>

Neo4J's graph query language, Cypher, was introduced before the actual NoSQL database like Neo4j became prominent. The introduction of Cypher is traced back to a time before Node.js and MongoDB emerged as major graph databases. These technologies developed during that period laid the groundwork for Neo4j as a successor with its own dedicated query language. Therefore, Cypher, which forms the basis of Neo4j's querying capabilities, was invented earlier than 2011.

**Answer:** Neo4J's graph query language, Cypher, was invented before Node.js and MongoDB became established in the early 2000s, following their initial release as main relational databases."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
