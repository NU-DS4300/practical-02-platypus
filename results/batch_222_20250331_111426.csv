Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me read through it again.

The context says that Redis is considered an in-memory database system, but it supports durability of data by saving snapshots at specific intervals or being append-only with a journal for roll-forward if there's a failure. Originally developed in 2009 in C++, and it can handle up to 100,000 set operations per second. It also mentions that Redis doesn't support complex data, only lookup by key.

Looking through the information given, I don't see any mention of when Redis was released. The context talks about its original development in 2009, but it doesn't specify a release date for Redis itself. So, without additional information from the context, I can't determine the exact release year.

Redis is mentioned to have been originally developed in 2009 using C++. However, the context does not provide any specific information about when Redis was released as a standalone product. Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no detailed information about Redis's release date.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me read through it again carefully.

The context mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system and supports durability. It talks about two methods of data durability: saving snapshots to disk at specific intervals or using a journal for roll-forward functionality. It also notes that originally developed in 2009 by C++ developers. Then, it states that Redis can handle up to 100,000 set operations per second and has a rich command set.

The query is asking when Redis was released. I don't see any information about when Redis was launched or when it was first made public in the context provided. The context focuses more on its durability features and capabilities rather than its release date. 

I remember that Redis was started around 2009, but I'm not sure if it was officially released until 2013 or earlier. So, without additional information from the context, I can't determine when Redis was actually released because it's not mentioned here.

The context does not provide information about when Redis was released, as it only mentions its durability features and capabilities.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.

The context mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system but says it was originally developed in 2009 in C++. It supports durability with options a and b. The speed is up to 100,000 set operations per second, and it has a rich collection of commands without handling complex data. It doesn't have secondary indexes; only lookup by key.

But the query is about when Redis was released, not its features or capabilities. I don't see any information about the release date in the context provided. The context gives me an overview of Redis's history and strengths but no specific dates for release.

I think this might be a trick question because I can't recall Redis being released by a specific date mentioned here. Maybe it was around 2014? Wait, actually, looking back at the context, the initial development was in 2009, so maybe Redis has had updates since then. Perhaps it was a version that came out after 2009.

I remember reading that Redis was released as an open-source project, and by 2014, there were several versions. I think Redis 1.x started around 2013 or later. So maybe Redis 2.x was introduced in 2015. But without specific dates mentioned here, it's hard to pin down.

I guess the answer is that the context doesn't provide information on when Redis was released, as it focuses more on its features and history than on a release date.

The context provided does not include any information about when Redis was released. Redis has been around for several years, with multiple versions being introduced after 2013. However, without specific dates mentioned in the context, I cannot provide an exact release year.
