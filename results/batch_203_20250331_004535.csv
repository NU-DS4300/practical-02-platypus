Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for its values based on the provided context. Let me go through each section and see if there's any information about data types.

Starting with page 19 of the NoSQL Intro document. It mentions that Redis typically uses a KV store model but can support other structures like Graph, Spatial, etc., depending on the use case. Under Data Types, it says the values are usually strings or lists, which makes sense because lists in Redis are implemented as linked lists.

Looking at page 22 of the same document, there's another section that talks about Direct Interaction with Redis commands. It mentions setting and getting KV pairs, but doesn't list specific data types. However, it does discuss durability features: saving snapshots or appending-only files which allows for roll-forward if something goes wrong.

Then, in page 17, it refers to Redis as a K/V store but also mentions other models like graph, etc., so maybe the focus here is more on KV structures since that's where data types are discussed. The document doesn't list specific data types but does talk about lists and sets.

Page 23 mentions many language libraries available, which could include different data types depending on the library, but I don't see any listed here.

The NoSQL Intro document also talks about rich command set for various structures, so Redis supports multiple types. The section on durability options (a) and (b) doesn't list specific data types either; it just mentions saving snapshots or appending-only files.

Page 5 of the NoSQL Intro document is titled ""Redis Data Types Keys"" with values listed as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (strings to strings), and geospatial data. That's clearly mentioned here: Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes with string similarity, Geospatial data 20.

Page 18 of the NoSQL Intro document is about Redis durability options, but doesn't list data types specifically. It just talks about how to handle durability—appending-only files or snapshots.

Putting this together: The most explicit mention of data types in the context provided is under ""Redis Data Types Keys"" at page 5, where it clearly lists all supported values. So even though other sections discuss different structures and support various commands, the primary data types Redis supports are strings, lists, sets, etc., as outlined there.

Therefore, I should list those key data types from that section.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- Strings
- Lists (implemented as linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets
- Hashes (which are strings to string mappings)
- Geospatial data with similarity 0.17

These types are fundamental in Redis, providing the necessary structure and operations for managing data efficiently."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for holding values. I remember Redis is an in-memory database system, but from the context provided, it seems like it's more about the command list and some documentation rather than actual SQL or NoSQL databases. 

Looking at the context, there's a section that mentions Redis being used as a KV store, which stands for Key-Value store. That makes me think of traditional databases where each record has a key and value, like in MongoDB or MySQL. But I also see some mention of it supporting lists, sets, hashes, etc., but those are more SQL-related terms.

In the ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" section on page 19, it says Redis Data Types Keys: and Values: Strings, Lists (linked lists), Sets (unique unsorted string elements), Sorted Sets, Hashes (string → string), with similarity 0.17. Wait, but those are terms from NoSQL contexts, so maybe that's a bit confusing.

Then there's a section on ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" about the database structure, which says Redis is mainly a KV store but can be used with other models like graph or time series. It also mentions commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs, lists, sets, etc. The data types supported by Redis for values include strings, hashes, numbers (ints, floats), dates, booleans, and geospatial data.

But wait, the earlier section seems to focus on key-value pairs as a KV store. So maybe there's some overlap here. If I'm trying to name the data types Redis supports, it might be both the values in key-value pairs and other types like strings, numbers, dates, etc., but perhaps not including things like integers or floats because those are more SQL.

Also, looking at ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf"" on page 17, they mention that Redis can handle various data types with commands. But I'm not sure if it's the same as NoSQL's key-value structure.

So to summarize, Redis supports values in key-value pairs where keys and values are strings or other NoSQL data types like integers or booleans. However, there are other command-based methods for handling lists, sets, dates, etc., which aren't related to NoSQL but more about traditional data structures.

Wait, the query is specifically asking about Redis's own supported data types for values, not considering them as part of a key-value structure. So in that case, from ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 19, it lists strings, hashes, etc., but these are more SQL terms. Then there's another section on commands related to data structures which includes various types like integers, floats, dates, booleans, etc.

I think I need to clarify that Redis is primarily a key-value store for NoSQL databases. So when they say ""data types supported by Redis,"" they might be referring to the values in key-value pairs as strings or other NoSQL data types, but there are also commands and functions that handle different data structures like lists, sets, etc., which aren't directly related to NoSQL.

So putting it all together, Redis supports a variety of data types for values based on both the traditional SQL-like key-value pair structure and its command-based handling of other structures. However, since the query is about Redis's own supported data types (as in, not as part of a key-value store but rather as a separate service), I should focus on the key-value structure.

In that case, the main data types are strings, integers, booleans, dates, and geospatial data. There are also other sets like Sorted Sets, but those aren't data types per se. So, probably, the answer is strings, integers, booleans, dates, geospatial data.
</think>

Redis supports various data types for values based on both its key-value structure and command-based operations. For key-value pairs used in NoSQL contexts, Redis primarily supports:

- **Strings**: Any text or binary sequence.
- **Integers (ints)**: Numeric whole numbers.
- **Booleans**: True/False values.
- **Dates**: Dates with time components.
- **Geospatial Data**: Coordinates for location data.

However, when considering Redis as a separate service for data structures and manipulation, the commands allow handling of different data types:

- **Integers (floats)**: Numeric values.
- **Booleans**: True/False.
- **Strings**: Any text or binary sequences.

Thus, Redis supports these key-value-related data types in NoSQL contexts, along with commands that handle various data structures."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. From the context provided, especially pages related to Redis and Python, it seems like Redis has a specific way of handling different kinds of data.

Looking at the sections about NoSQL databases, I see that they mention strings can be any binary sequence, but also lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. However, these are more for value types rather than the actual data stored.

Then, in the section on Redis Database and Interaction, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. They refer to a list of commands related to setting and getting KV pairs. But I don't see any discussion about different data types here.

The Python section talks about using Redis as a client library with the 'redis' package in Python. It includes string commands for operations like mset, mget, set, and incr. The examples given are for storing values like integers or strings but again, they're more focused on how to retrieve and manipulate data rather than what types of values can be stored.

The section about connecting from DataGrip guides students to the Redis client with a specific port, which suggests that Redis is built to handle various data types efficiently. But the actual documentation doesn't go into detail about the different value types they support.

Putting this all together, it seems like Redis primarily supports strings as values for KV stores or mappings because in-memory databases are optimized for fast lookups and minimal storage. They don’t have specific commands or documentation to handle lists, sets, hashes, etc., which suggests that these are more suited for other data models like graphs or vectors.

Therefore, the answer should mention that Redis supports strings as values but not lists, sets, hashes, etc., because those are typically handled by different architectures.
