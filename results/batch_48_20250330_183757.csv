Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was actually released based on the context provided. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I see that there are a few files listed from Redis. The first file is ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17, chunk Redis DB)"". In this section, it mentions that Redis is an open-source, in-memory database and refers to it as a ""data structure store."" It also notes that Redis primarily uses KV stores but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. Then, under another file, ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22, chunk Redis Database and Interaction)"", it lists Redis as providing 16 databases by default, numbered 0 to 15.

Next, the third file is ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 18, chunk Redis - It is considered an in-memory database system, but… - Supports durability of data by: a) essentially saving snapshots to disk at speciﬁc intervals or b) append-only ﬁle which is a journal of changes that can be used for roll-forward if there is a failure - Originally developed in 2009 in C++ - Can be very fast … > 100,000 SET ops / second - Rich collection of commands - Does NOT handle complex data. No secondary indexes.""

Looking at this, the file specifically mentions that Redis was originally developed in 2009 in C++. It goes on to say it can be very fast with 100,000 SET operations per second and has a rich set of commands.

The fourth file is ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 1, chunk Redis-py 2 - Redis-py is the standard client for Python. - Maintained by the Redis Company itself - GitHub Repo: redis/redis-py - In your 4300 Conda Environment: pip install redis) with similarity 0.30"" which just states that Redis-py is the standard client for Python but doesn't mention when Redis was released.

The fifth file, ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22, chunk Redis Database and Interaction)"", talks about Redis providing 16 databases and supports durability with snapshots or append-only journals. It also mentions it does not handle complex data but does support lookup by key. The sixth file is ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12, chunk Redis in Context 13) with similarity 0.34"" again just restates that Redis-py is used for Python.

The seventh file, ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 18, chunk Redis - It is considered an in-memory database system, but… - Supports durability of data by: a) essentially saving snapshots to disk at speciﬁc intervals or b) append-only ﬁle which is a journal of changes that can be used for roll-forward if there is a failure - Originally developed in 2009 in C++ - Can be very fast … > 100,000 SET ops / second - Rich collection of commands - Does NOT handle complex data. No secondary indexes."" This file explicitly states that Redis was developed in 2009.

The eighth file is ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 13, chunk Redis in Context 14) with similarity 0.34"" which again repeats the information from the previous file about Redis-py and its popularity on Conda.

So compiling all this information: The main release date mentioned is under Redis Database and Interaction where it says Redis was developed in 2009. Other parts like Redis-py mention Python, but that's a client product related to Redis, not the database itself. Therefore, the primary release date for Redis as an open-source in-memory database system should be 2009.

Redis was originally developed in 2009 by the Redis Company in C++. It is known for its ability to process up to 100,000 set operations per second and offers a rich collection of commands."|redis|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was actually released. Let me start by looking through all the context provided. 

First, there's a section from page 17 that mentions Redis is an in-memory database system but doesn't go into detail about its release date. Another part on page 18 talks about Redis supporting durability with snapshots and being fast at handling large sets of operations. That gives me some clue about Redis's history.

There are chunks discussing Redis's history, including versions from 2009 when it was first developed in C++. The document then shifts to Python integration where Redis is used as a client library. This makes me think about the original development timeline since C++ wasn't around for very long before modern programming languages emerged.

The section on page 19 mentions Redis being widely used and the need for efficient storage, especially with big datasets. That suggests Redis was in use during the late 2000s or early 2010s when Python started becoming more popular for development.

Pages 20-21 talk about Redis's data types and how it can be used in containerization tools like Docker. This is part of its adoption across various applications, further indicating that Redis was released around that time.

Looking at the chunks on page 22 about connection settings, there are commands related to port configuration and security considerations. These parts reinforce the idea that Redis had a stable release when Docker was being used for development or deployment.

Putting all these pieces together—C++ development history, Python integration, data usage across industries, and modern programming practices—it seems clear that Redis was released in 2009 as C++. The subsequent use of Redis in Python frameworks likely continued this timeline.
</think>

Redis was introduced in **2009** as a C++-based in-memory database system. Its rapid adoption and widespread use in various applications, including Python development, data containerization tools like Docker, and across industries, further solidified its release date.

Answer: Redis was released in 2009."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, I need to figure out when Redis was first released. Let me look through the context provided. 

In the context, there are several PDFs discussing Redis. The first one is ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 17. It mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases and refers to it as an in-memory database system. But I don't see any information about its release year here.

Next, the same document also talks about Redis being maintained by the company itself. The GitHub repository is listed as redis/redis-py. However, there's no mention of a specific release date for this repository either. It just says it's in a 4300 Conda Environment and is used with Python.

Then, looking at another PDF from the same year, ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" it's part of the context but doesn't provide information about when Redis was released. The document mentions that Redis is maintained by Redis itself and provides documentation on GitHub. Again, no release date is given here either.

I'm noticing that the query only asks for the release date, so maybe the context doesn't provide enough information to answer it definitively. However, based on common knowledge, I know that Redis was released in early 2009 as part of a C++ project by Memcached. But in the provided context, there's no mention of that release year.

Since the context doesn't include details about Redis's official release date and only discusses Redis versions compatible with different languages like Python, Java, etc., I can infer that the actual release date isn't covered here. Therefore, it seems like the answer cannot be accurately determined from the given context.
</think>

The provided context does not contain information about when Redis was first released. Redis has been around for over a decade and was originally developed in 2009 as part of the C++ project by Memcached. The exact release date is no longer relevant here since it's beyond the scope of the context.

**Answer:** Redis was not officially released in the provided context; its version details are beyond the information given."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|1000|100|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
