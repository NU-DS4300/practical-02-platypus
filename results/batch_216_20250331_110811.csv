Alright, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me read through it carefully.

The context mentions ""Originally developed in 2009 in C++."" That's a clue. So the system started around 2009. But I'm not sure if that means it's the year it was released or when it was first published.

I recall that Redis has been around for a while, so starting in 2009 might be just the beginning of its life as an open-source project. It likely took some time to gain mainstream adoption and recognition after development began.

So, putting this together, Redis probably wasn't released in 2009 but rather from when it was first developed, which is earlier. But without specific information about a release date beyond the start year, I can only speculate that its official release might be around early 2017 or so when it started being widely used and recognized.

The Redis project was originally developed in 2009 using C++. However, Redis as an open-source project began to gain recognition and mainstream adoption much later. The most recent release date of Redis would likely be after the development period ended, around early 2017."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking when Redis was released based on the given context. First, I need to look through the provided text and find any mention of Redis being introduced or released.

Looking at the context, it mentions that Redis was originally developed in 2009 in C++. So that gives me a starting point. But I don't see ""Redis"" mentioned there directly except for its originator.

Then, it talks about Redis as an in-memory database system with durability featuresâ€”like saving snapshots or being append-only. It also mentions that Redis is known for being very fast and can handle 100,000 set operations per second, which are used for operations like adding elements to the collection.

Wait, I don't see any part of this text that says when Redis was released. The information given is about its development history and features. There's no specific date mentioned in the context provided.

So, based on the context, I can only say that Redis was first introduced around 2009 as a C++ implementation but isn't explicitly stated to have been released by then. It might still be running or being maintained post-2009, but without more information from the text, I can't give an exact release date.

I don't see any references to Redis being released again in this context, so it's likely that the answer is that Redis wasn't released specifically in 2018 as initially thought. Instead, its features and availability would depend on current developments or maintenance schedules.

The text provided does not specify a release date for Redis beyond its originator from 2009. Therefore, when asking about its release, the answer would be that it was first introduced in 2009 as a C++ implementation but remains under development and supported post-2009.

Answer: Redis was first introduced in 2009 as a C++ implementation, but it is not explicitly stated to have been released by that time."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the context provided. Let me read through it carefully.

The context mentions a PDF document titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf."" It talks about Redis being an in-memory database system and discusses its durability features. It also states that Redis was originally developed in 2009 in C++. 

So, the key point here is ""Redis was originally developed in 2009 in C++."" That gives me a direct answer to when Redis was released.

I should make sure there's no other information from the context that contradicts this. The document also mentions its durability features like saving snapshots and being append-only, but those are more about how it works than when it was released.

Therefore, the answer is straightforward: Redis was developed in 2009.
