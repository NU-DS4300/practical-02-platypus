Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, there's a chunk from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" which mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. The names are numbered from 0 to 15. That seems straightforward. So right away, I can note that Redis supports 16 specific in-memory databases.

Then, looking further down the same document, there's another section titled ""Redis - It is considered an in-memory database system..."". Here, it says they support durability of data with a specific feature: either saving snapshots to disk at certain intervals or being append-only. But that doesn't directly answer how many databases Redis supports, so I can ignore this part for the count.

Moving on to ""Redis + Python.pdf"", the text explains that Redis-py is the standard client for Python and is maintained by Redis itself. It also mentions a Conda environment setup but doesn't add any numbers or details about the number of supported databases here either.

Looking back at the previous section, it still states that Redis supports 16 databases numbered 0 to 15. The later part about geospatial data isn't relevant to the count of database numbers.

So, compiling all this information, Redis has a total of 16 in-memory databases by default, each with unique identifiers from 0 through 15.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15 and are referred to as ""data source IDs."" The durability features mentioned later don't affect the database count but highlight Redis's capability to store snapshots for data integrity."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through each relevant part carefully.

First, there's a chunk from page 22 which mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So that's 16 specific databases. 

Then, looking at the next paragraph, it says Redis is an in-memory data structure store and can be used with various models like graphs, spatial data, time series, etc., but it primarily supports KV stores. It mentions it has a rich collection of commands for managing key-value pairs and doesn't handle complex data that requires secondary indexes.

In another part, Redis-py is introduced as the standard client for Python, maintained by the company itself. This indicates that Redis supports multiple databases, not just the default 16, because it's specifically for Python. 

The other parts don't seem to provide additional information about how many databases Redis has beyond its in-memory approach and integration with different programming languages like Python.

So putting this together, Redis uses 16 default databases, but through various modules or extensions, it can integrate with additional databases. For example, Redis-py integrates with Redis database types like sets, which might be part of larger systems that support more than just the basics.

Therefore, considering all the information, Redis supports at least the 16 default databases and can connect to other databases through its Python client, but the primary number based on the context is 16.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me start by reading through each chunk carefully.

First, there's a PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" with several chunks. The first chunk talks about Redis providing 16 default databases, numbered from 0 to 15. It mentions that there are no other names associated and that direct interaction with Redis is done through commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs.

Looking at the second chunk, it's similar but seems to provide a ranking of KV stores. The third chunk discusses the durability features of Redis: snapshots are saved periodically or as an append-only file containing changes for roll-forward if something goes wrong.

The fourth chunk focuses on Redis's capabilitiesâ€”speed is mentioned, with 100,000 set operations per second being fast. It also lists data types like strings, lists, sets, etc., and mentions it doesn't handle complex queries beyond simple lookups by key.

Moving to the next PDF ""Redis + Python.pdf"", there's a section about Redis command list which includes filters for targeting specific database structures (like list, hash, set), and mentions that this is an exhaustive list. However, each PDF only provides snippets of information, so I can't rely on the full documents here.

Putting it all together: The first context chunk clearly states that Redis supports 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. It doesn't mention any other types or additional services beyond these 16.
