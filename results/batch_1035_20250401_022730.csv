Alright, let's try to figure out how to approach this query about the data types supported by Redis for values.

First, I need to recall what I know about Redis and its data types. From the context provided, I remember that Redis has a specific structure when it comes to data types. They're divided into two main categories: keys (which are strings) and non-key data types like sets, lists, sorted sets, hashes, etc.

Looking at the context snippets, I see references to strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes in the ""Values"" section. So, it seems that Redis supports these as different types of values.

In the Python examples provided, they use r.set, r.get, r.incr for setting and getting values. For example, when a value is stored in a set, you can retrieve it later to see its contents. This aligns with the idea that sets are unique, unsorted collections of elements, which makes sense given how Redis stores them.

The context also mentions ""sorted sets,"" which are similar to sets but maintain order. Lists and hashes (which map keys to values) are another part of this structure. So, each data type in Redis has its own role and method for interacting with it.

I should make sure that the answer covers all the main data types: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, unique elements in sets, hashes, and geospatial data. Also, I need to mention how they are stored internally, as Redis uses these structures for efficient operations.

Wait, did the context mention any other specific data types? From what's shown, it seems comprehensive. So, I can confidently list all these types as supported by Redis for values.

Redis supports several key data types for storing and retrieving values. These include:

1. **Strings**: Simple text fields.
2. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements.
3. **Sorted Sets**: Ordered sets where elements are maintained in a specific sequence.
4. **Unique Elements (Non-Set Values)**: Ensures that each element is stored only once, even if the same key appears multiple times.
5. **Hashes**: Maps keys to values using strings as keys, often for case-sensitive lookups.
6. **Geospatial Data 20**: Handles geospatial information with similarity, supporting points and polygons.

Each data type in Redis is designed for specific operations and storage strategies, such as sets being used when unique elements are required efficiently."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. From the context provided, it seems like they've given some examples of commands and outputs from using Redis with Python.

First, looking at the ""String Commands"" section on page 5, there's an example where you create a set with `r.set('key', value)` and then retrieve it using `r.get(key)`, which returns a list. This shows that sets can hold lists of values. So, I should note that Redis supports sets.

Next, in the ""String Commands"" section on page 4, they show setting a key to an integer using `r.set('key', value)` and then incrementing it with `r.incr('key')`. When retrieved, it returns the incremented count as an integer. This means integers are supported as values.

The ""Redis in Context 13"" section mentions that Redis supports various data types, including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. Each of these can store different kinds of binary sequences. For example, strings can be anything like dates or numbers, while hashes map keys to key-value pairs where both are typically strings.

In the ""True converter them (decodes) to strings"" section on page 2, they demonstrate how to handle data that might come in a dictionary format, which is converted back into string values. This shows flexibility in how Redis stores and retrieves data, even when inputs are complex.

Putting this all together, Redis supports several types of values: integers, strings (which can be any binary sequence), lists (lists of values), sets (sets of unique values), sorted sets (sorted sets of unique values), and hashes (maps keys to key-value pairs where both the key and value are strings). This is especially useful for storing structured data efficiently.

 Redis supports several types of values, including integers, strings (which can be any binary sequence), lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. These capabilities make it suitable for storing a wide variety of data structures.

Answer: Redis supports several types of values. The supported types include:

1. **Integers**: These are straightforward numeric values.
2. **Strings**: Strings in Redis can contain any binary sequence, such as dates, numbers, or text.
3. **Lists**: Lists store collections of items and return them as lists when accessed.
4. **Sets**: Sets store unique elements and can be unsorted, with sorted sets offering ordered results.
5. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but guarantee the order of elements.
6. **Hashes (Maps)**: Hashes map keys to values where both are typically strings.

These features allow Redis to efficiently handle various data structures for storing and retrieving data."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Redis supports as a data type for values. Let me see... I remember that Redis has some specific types, especially when it comes to handling data. From the context provided, there are two PDFs and some chunks about string commands. 

In the first PDF from 05, it mentions that the values can be strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, or hashes. That makes sense because those are common data structures in programming languages like Python. So, Redis probably supports these as well.

Looking at the second PDF from 06 about Redis and Python, there's a chunk on string commands. It shows how to set a value, get it back, increment it, and retrieve it again. This indicates that strings are supported for values, which aligns with what I saw in the first document.

I also remember reading somewhere that Redis has types like Integer, String, Date, etc., but the context doesn't specify these. The PDF mentions binary sequences as values, so maybe they include all possible binary data types or just specific ones like strings and others. 

I'm a bit confused about whether it's only for certain types or if there are more. But based on the information provided, it seems Redis primarily supports String, List, Set, Sorted Set, and Hash as value types.

Redis supports several data types for values, including:

1. **Strings**: Basic text handling using UTF-8 encoding.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Can store multiple elements in a sequence.
3. **Sets**: Store unique elements; each element can appear only once.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain order and allow duplicate entries.
5. **Hashes (Mappings)**: Store key-value pairs, useful for complex data structures.
6. **Geospatial Data 20**: Represents geospatial information, though not directly related to values.

 Redis does not explicitly mention integers or dates in its context provided, suggesting that it may include all binary sequences as value types beyond strings."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
