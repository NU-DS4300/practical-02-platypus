Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j created its graph query language, known as Cypher. The user provided a context that explains what Neo4j is and gives some information about its query language. The key part of the context mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011 with Cypher. 

So, looking at the answer given earlier, it correctly states that Neo4j's Cypher was invented in 2011. That matches what I know from the context. Since the user is asking about this exact query, I don't think there's any other relevant information needed here. The answer provided is accurate based on the context and what I know about Neo4j's history.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j. It's a NoSQL database used for graph databases, right? And the context provided mentions that Cypher is the query language they use.

Looking at the context link, ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf,"" it specifically talks about the development of Cypher and mentions the addition of APOC plugins in 2011. There's also a mention of the Graph Data Science Plugin with similarity 0.18. The query language is mentioned to be comparable to SQL but used for graphs.

I remember that before Neo4j, there were other graph databases like Strongly Aggregated Graph (SAG) and TinkerDB/Graph DB. They all had their own query languages and plugins for handling graph data. But Neo4j was one of the first, right?

The document from 2011 specifically talks about when APOC plugin was added to Neo4j. The context says that Cypher is based on an SQL-like language but designed for graphs. So if APOC was introduced around there, maybe that's when they developed a query language or plugins.

I think the key points are that Neo4j used the APOC plugin starting in 2011 and introduced Cypher as the query language. Since it was based on an SQL system but for graphs, perhaps the development of Cypher was part of their graph-focused architecture.

So putting this together, Neo4j's graph query language was definitely introduced around early 2011 when they added the APOC plugin with Cypher.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was indeed introduced in early 2011. The context mentions that APOC (Awesome Procedures on Cypher) was added to Neo4j starting that year, providing a set of procedures for handling graph data. Therefore, the development of the query language and associated tools occurred around 2011.

**Answer:** The graph query language, Cypher, was introduced in early 2011 when the APOC plugin was added to Neo4j."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language, called Cypher, was invented. From the context provided, it seems like the user is asking about the invention date of Cypher. The context mentions that Cypher was created in 2011, but it also gives some background on why that year.

Looking at the answer given earlier, it's stated that Cypher was created by a team led by David Voss, Tom metric, and Rakesh Mistry in 2011. This aligns with the context provided where Neo4j's graph query language was mentioned as being built around this time. 

I should check if there's any other information from the context that might affect this answer. The context doesn't mention any inventions or when Neo4j itself was created, just the Cypher part. So, focusing solely on Cypher seems to be correct based on the provided text.

Therefore, the answer is accurate given the context. I don't see any conflicting information from elsewhere in the query, so I can confidently say that Cypher was invented in 2011.
