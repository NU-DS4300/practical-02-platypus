Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me read through the query again. The user is asking about the number of databases Redis supports.

Looking at the context, there's a PDF file that starts with ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf."" It mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. So that's right away a number I can identify from that section.

Then in another PDF, ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" it states that Redis-py is the standard client for Python and maintained by the Redis Company itself. However, this information doesn't directly answer how many databases Redis supports because Redis-py might just be one of their products rather than all of their database support.

I should focus on the first PDF which clearly mentions 16 databases. The other document talks about Redis-py being the client but doesn't state the total number of supported databases.

So, putting it together, Redis supports a total of 16 databases based solely on the information in the first PDF.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through each relevant part step by step.

First, I see a section from page 22, chunk about Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered 0 to 15. That's clear. So that's 16 databases right there. 

Then, on page 23, it mentions Redis is an open source, in-memory database system. The context says it primarily focuses on KV store functionality but can handle other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. But I'm not sure how many types of data stores it supports beyond KV.

Looking at the other chunks from pages 17 and 20-21, they discuss Redis as a language library and point out that it has rich collections of commands. They also mention that Redis doesn't handle complex data beyond simple lookups by key. This reinforces the idea that Redis is mainly designed for KV stores.

The paragraph on setting up Redis in Docker from page 20-21 talks about port settings, which are related to database configuration but not directly about the number of databases it supports. So, this might be a distractor or less relevant information.

In the section on connecting from DataGrip on page 21, they mention using Redis as a data source in Docker Desktop and provide some settings, but again, this doesn't change the fact that Redis supports 16 databases. 

Finally, the sections on distributed systems on pages 16 and 17 discuss replication and sharding, which is about how data can be stored across multiple nodes, but it's not directly related to the number of distinct databases Redis supports.

So, putting it all together, Redis supports exactly 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. The other information doesn't add to this number and may be discussing Redis' functionality or how it can be used in different contexts.

Redis supports a total of **16 databases** by default, numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me go through each relevant part step by step.

First, in the ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" page 22, there's a chunk that says Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. It mentions they don't have any other names associated with them and explains how direct interaction is done through commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs or variations.

Another section on the same page (page 23) talks about Redis being an open-source in-memory database system that primarily acts as a KV store but can be used with various models like Graph, Spatial, etc. It also mentions that Redis supports durability of data through snapshots and append-only files. However, this part doesn't specifically mention the number of databases it provides.

Looking at other sections, for example, ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf"" page 19, there's a mention of Redis Data Types which includes keys, values, sets, hashes, etc., but that doesn't directly answer the question about the number of databases Redis supports. The section on Setting Up Redis in Docker (page 20) talks about using Redis as a client in Python with Docker, but again, it's more about setup and commands than the database count.

The other sections, like ""From 03 - Moving Beyond the Relational Model.pdf"" page 16, discuss distributed data stores which include both relational and non-relational models, highlighting replication and sharding. They mention systems that support both, but this doesn't address Redis's specific database support numbers.

So, putting it all together, the main section that clearly states the number of databases Redis supports is on page 22 where it lists 16 databases from 0 to 15. All other sections either discuss how Redis works as a KV store, with or without additional models, or provide setup instructions but don't specify the database count.

Therefore, the answer is that Redis supports 16 databases.

Based on the context provided:

Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. These are distributed across various types such as KV stores and other models like Graph or Spatial data storage systems.
