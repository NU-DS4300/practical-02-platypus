Okay, so the user is asking about when Redis was released. I need to figure this out based on the provided context. Let's see... The context has several files and chunks related to Redis. 

Looking through each file, I find two mentions of Redis. The first one is from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 18, chunk Redis - It says Redis was originally developed in 2009. That's a clear date. 

Then there's another file, ""Redis + Python.pdf,"" which has chunks mentioning Redis-py as the standard client for Python and its GitHub repo. But I don't see an explicit release date here. However, since the first chunk provides a specific year, that seems more reliable.

I should probably mention both pieces of information but make sure to point out that Redis was released in 2009 in the earlier file. The second one doesnâ€™t have a release date, so I'll focus on the first entry.

From the context provided, Redis was mentioned as being originally developed in 2009. This is the specific year noted in the relevant chunk of ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf.""

Okay, I need to find out when Redis was released based on the given context. Let me look through each relevant section.

Starting with the first document from NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, page 18, it says Redis is an in-memory database system and supports durability. It mentions that originally developed in 2009 in C++. So Redis was created around 2009.

Looking at the other documents:

From NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17), it describes Redis as a data structure store, primarily for Key-Value pairs, and mentions being open source. It doesn't explicitly state when it was released but says originally in C++, so around 2009.

The next document is about Redis + Python.pdf, page 12. It states Redis is the standard client for Python and maintained by Redis Company. This confirms that Redis was indeed developed starting from 2009, as noted before.

There are other sections like DS/ML from Redis, which I can't access right now, but they probably follow a similar timeline since it's related to Redis.

The answer should be around 2009.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was actually released based on the context provided. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the query, it's asking about the release date of Redis. The context includes several documents, but I'm focusing on sections where the release date is mentioned or clearly stated.

In ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 18, chunk Redis)"", it says that Redis was originally developed in 2009 using C++. Then it mentions Redis has been around since then. Wait, no, actually, that section says Redis started in 2009 but emphasizes that they've been around longer than that.

But the specific release date isn't explicitly stated there. So I need to check other sections for any mention of when Redis was released or if it's implied by other information provided.

Looking at ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 17, chunk Redis DB - Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database..."" again, same thing. They just say Redis is an open-source in-memory database system that started in 2009. So I'm not seeing a specific release date here.

Now looking at ""Redis + Python.pdf (page 12, chunk Redis-py 2 - Redis-py is the standard client for Python."" It doesn't mention when Redis was released either. The focus is on using it with Python and having certain features.

Then in ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22, chunk Redis Database and Interaction"" again, no release date mentioned. They talk about providing 16 databases by default and direct interaction commands.

In the same file's page 23, they mention that Redis is an open-source project, but not a specific version. It just says it started in 2009. So I'm still not finding a clear release date from this context.

I don't see any other sections that provide information about Redis's release year. The closest related information is that Redis has been around since 2009, but the exact release date isn't specified. Therefore, based on the given context, I can only conclude that Redis was developed in 2009 or later, specifically as an open-source project.
</think>

The context provided does not explicitly state when Redis was released. However, it is known to be a development starting from 2009 and remains part of an ongoing project since then.
