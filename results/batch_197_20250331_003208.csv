Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports as values. I'm not very familiar with Redis beyond what's given in that context, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, looking at the context provided, there are several chunks about Redis. Let me go through each one step by step to gather information on Redis' value support.

1. The first chunk talks about Redis Data Types Keys and Values. It lists key types like strings, lists, sets, etc., and Value types as Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, and Geospatial data. So that's a good starting point. I can note the values mentioned here: Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes.

2. The second chunk discusses Redis databases in general. It mentions it's an in-memory database system with features like durability (save snapshots or append-only files) and supports complex data. But it doesn't specify which types of data Redis is best suited for. Maybe I should remember that Redis isn't ideal for complex data.

3. The third chunk lists Redis' command list from 05's document. It mentions specific commands, but nothing about the data types they support. So maybe this section isn't directly helpful for values.

4. The fourth chunk is about Redis in Python. It gives a brief overview of the documentation and some highlights without listing all supported data types. I can see that it mentions 16 databases by default, each numbered from 0 to 15, but doesn't specify the exact value types they support.

5. The fifth chunk discusses Redis's durability features: saving snapshots at specific intervals or appending-only files (which is a journal for roll-forward if data fails). This feature affects how data is managed but isn't directly about the values themselves.

From the first chunk, I can see that values include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. The second and third chunks don't add new value information beyond what's already in the first. The fourth and fifth chunks are more about commands and Python integration rather than data types.

I should also consider if there are any specific examples or additional info I'm missing that could clarify Redis' supported values further. But based on the context provided, the key points are:

- Values: Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes
- The other parts discuss Redis's overall capabilities and integration with Python but don't specify data types.

So putting it all together, I can confidently say that Redis primarily supports strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes as values.

Redis primarily supports the following data types for its values:

- **Strings**: Simple text or alphanumeric values.
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of elements.
- **Sets**: Unsorted, unique elements in an ordered structure.
- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintains order.
- **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Key-value pairs that can be complex and useful for specific data needs.

 Redis is optimized for these types due to its in-memory design and ease of use."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for values. Let me start by looking through the context provided.

First, in one of the sections about Redis as a database, it mentions that Redis primarily handles KV stores, which are key-value pairs. The section lists some common data types: strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which are unordered and have unique elements), sorted sets, hashes (which map keys to values), and geospatial data with similarity measures.

Wait, the context also has a part about Redis being an in-memory database system that's very fast. It mentions things like durability—saving snapshots or appending-only files for roll-forwardability. But it doesn't discuss other data types beyond the KV store basics. 

Then there's another section about Redis as a Python client. It lists some commands related to key-value operations, but again, it doesn’t talk about different data types the client can handle.

Looking at the connection example from DataGrip, they show how to set, get, increment, and retrieve key-value pairs using Redis. That reinforces that it's designed for KV storage, not other types like dates or numbers.

The other parts of the context mention Redis supports various operations like SQL commands, but those are more about data manipulation, not the data types themselves. There's also a section on connecting from DataGrip, which again is using key-value pairs.

Since all the relevant sections focus on KV stores and don't discuss other data types, I think it's safe to conclude that Redis primarily supports strings and certain sets of structured data like lists, hashes, etc., but not other complex or numerical types.
</think>

Redis primarily supports several structured data types as values in key-value pairs. These include:

- **Strings**: Any text or character-based data.
- **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Ordered collections of items.
- **Sets**: Unordered collections that contain unique elements.
- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but with the ability to maintain insertion order.
- **Hashes**: Mappings from keys to values, typically using strings for keys and values.

Redis does not support other data types beyond these key-value pairs."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. From the context provided, especially pages related to Redis, I see that it mentions different types of storage and operations. Let me go through each relevant section.

First, there's a section about Redis Data Types and Keys. It says that the keys can be strings or any binary sequence. So, the value type is strings in this case. Then it lists several data types: Strings, Lists (which are linked lists), Sets (which are unique and unsorted string elements), Sorted Sets, Hashes (which map strings to strings), and Geospatial data with a specific similarity score.

Next, there's a section on Redis being an in-memory database that doesn't handle complex data like objects or sequences. It mentions durability of data through snapshots and append-only files, which can be rolled over if something fails. Also, it notes that Redis is primarily a KV store but can be used with other models. The commands mentioned include looking up by key, setting, getting, incrementing counts, etc.

Looking further into the Python documentation section, there's a string command example where you set a key, get it back as a list of values, and then increment that value. This shows how Redis can store strings in various forms but always treats them as strings unless specified otherwise.

The DataGrip file guide mentions connecting to Redis with a name and port, testing the connection works, which is a good practice tip for using Redis effectively.

In another section, there's a simplified example from FeatureForm explaining the three common architectures: KV store, Time Series, and Graph. This reinforces that while Redis is a KV store, it can be extended for other purposes.

Putting this all together, I see Redis primarily supports strings as values in various forms (like sets, lists) but not objects or complex data types. It's optimized for lookups but has some features to handle more structured data through its interaction commands.
</think>

The primary data type Redis supports is a string. While it can store other structures like sets and lists, these are treated as strings internally. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Strings**: The base storage, used in various forms such as sets (unique elements) or hashes (mapped values).
2. **Sets**: Stores unique elements, always strings.
3. **Lists**: Contains strings in a linked list format.

Redis is optimized for lookups but can be extended with its interaction commands and other commands from the FeatureForm documentation."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
