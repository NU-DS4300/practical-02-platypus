Alright, so I need to figure out how to determine which data types Redis supports for values based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

Looking at the first section from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, it mentions that Redis Data Types Keys can be ""usually strings but can be any binary sequence."" That means Redis supports strings as keys in JSON objects or arrays, and they can hold various types of data. The values are mentioned to include Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, and Geospatial data.

The second section is from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf. Here, there are chunks about string commands. One example shows how to set a value using `r.set('key', 'value')`, then retrieve it with `r.get(key)` which returns the stored value as a list of strings. Another command uses `r.incr(key, count)`, increments the value, and retrieves it again.

I notice that these examples only deal with string values but don't show any other types. So far, from both sections, I've identified that Redis supports Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, and Geospatial data as possible values for keys or items in JSON objects or arrays.

Wait, are there any other potential data types? The context doesn't mention anything else, so I think that's all based on the information given. So the answer should list these data types clearly.
</think>

 Redis supports several data types for storing and retrieving values as keys or items within JSON objects or arrays:

1. **Strings**: Can be simple or complex strings, containing any binary sequence.
2. **Lists (or Vectors)**: Can store multiple values. Each value is a string, list, set, etc., but each element is unique in a Set.
3. **Sets**: Unique elements that can hold strings, lists, sets, hashes, etc., and cannot contain duplicate entries.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to Sets but maintain order based on insertion time.
5. **Hashes**: Use keys as input (a string or binary sequence) and return the corresponding value, which is a string of integer hash values representing the key's strength.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Includes coordinates such as latitude and longitude, formatted with an ID.

These data types are supported for both keys and items within Redis structures, facilitating efficient management of diverse data through its Key-Value Store (KVS) architecture."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context. Let me go through each section and note down the relevant information.

Starting with ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" it mentions that Redis is a NoSQL database and supports various data types: strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. So from this, I can list each of these as supported types.

Next, the chapter on ""Redis + Python.pdf"" has some examples in the code snippets. They use rpush to add elements to a set and rset to remove them. Also, mget retrieves values from keys. These commands correspond to specific data types: strings are used for key-value pairs, lists handle collections of items, sets ensure uniqueness without duplicates, hashes transform values into keys or vice versa, and geospatial data with similarity applies.

Looking through other sections like the database section on ""KV Stores,"" Redis is described as a KV store which supports both strings and list types. Geospatial support uses similarity for spatial data operations.

Putting it all together, the supported data types for values are: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data with specific operations.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for storing values include:

1. **Strings**: Used as key-value pairs.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Store collections of items in a sequential manner.
3. **Sets**: Ensure uniqueness of elements without duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Maintain order when retrieving sorted elements.
5. **Hashes**: Transform values into keys or keys into values, useful for operations requiring bi-directional mappings.
6. **Geospatial Data**: Supported with functions that handle spatial data.

These types are essential for efficient storage and retrieval of various data structures in Redis."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out which data types Redis supports for storing and retrieving values. Let me start by looking through the context provided.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro"" section, they mention that Redis provides 16 databases by default. Each database is numbered from 0 to 15. There's no specific name associated with them, so I assume each is a separate database within Redis. These are referred to as direct interactions via commands related to setting and getting k/v pairs or variations.

Next, in the ""Redis Database and Interaction"" section under NoSQL Intro, it says Redis is an in-memory database system that can be very fast, handling up to 100,000 SET operations per second. It supports durability through snapshots and append-only files. The primary focus is on supporting lookup by key.

Looking at the other sections, some parts discuss Redis as a ML (Machine Learning) framework using Python. They mention commands like mset, mget, set, get, hset, hget, etc., which are part of Redis-specific libraries or modules. These commands allow for more complex operations but don't change the fundamental data types Redis can handle.

The ""Redis in DS/ML"" section refers to how Redis is used within feature stores, mentioning MadWithML. It doesn't add new data types beyond what's already covered elsewhere.

In the context about K/V pairs, it notes that even though Redis isn't designed for complex data like graphs or vectors, its simplicity and speed make it suitable for many use cases. The support for k/v pairs means it can store structured data but primarily functions as a KV store.

Putting this all together: Redis is primarily used to store key-value pairs, supports various types of sets (like lists, sorted sets), hashes, and even binary sequences. It has 16 databases in total, each acting like a different storage environment for the same data structure. The presence of specific commands in other sections doesn't expand the core data types Redis supports beyond its KV nature.
</think>

Redis primarily supports key-value pairs for storing values. Here are the main data types it handles:

1. **Strings**: Used as keys and values directly.
2. **Lists (Arrays)**: Data structures that can contain multiple elements, accessed by index.
3. **Sorted Sets**: A set of unique elements sorted in a specific order.
4. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Maps keys to values using any type of value.
5. **Binary Sequences**: Columns where each entry is a binary sequence.

Redis also supports 16 databases, each managing the same data structure but under different names. These are referred to as direct interaction commands and primarily function as KV stores."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
