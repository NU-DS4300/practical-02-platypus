I don't know. The context provided is about data replication and monotonic read consistency, which appears to be unrelated to AVL trees or their rotation requirements. The query is asking about a specific type of imbalance in an AVL tree that requires multiple rotations, but this information is not present in the given context.|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The provided context is about monotonic read consistency and anomalies in distributed systems, which doesn't seem to be related to AVL trees or imbalances in them. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context. If you'd like to provide more relevant information or context, I'll do my best to help!|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The provided context is about NoSQL databases and optimistic concurrency control, which doesn't seem to be related to AVL trees or their rotation mechanisms. Therefore, I'm not able to provide a relevant answer for your query. If you have any further information or clarification regarding the context, I'd be happy to help!|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
