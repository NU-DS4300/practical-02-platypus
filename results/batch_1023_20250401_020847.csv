"According to the provided context, the data types supported by Redis for Values are:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

These data types allow Redis to be used as a key-value store with various value formats, making it a versatile NoSQL database."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)
6. Geospatial data

These data types can be used as values in a Redis key-value pair, where the key is usually a string but can be any binary sequence."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
