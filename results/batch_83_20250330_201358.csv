Okay, so I need to figure out which data types Redis supports for values based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.

The context talks about Redis Data Types Keys and Values in a PDF document. It lists different keys and their corresponding Value definitions. The relevant points are:

- Strings: Any binary sequence.
- Lists: Linked lists of items, which can be any type.
- Sets: Unique items; they can't have duplicates, but the order doesn't matter.
- Sorted Sets: Similar to sets, but sorted in a specific order.
- Hashes (also called Mappings): These take a key and return a value. The keys are typically strings, but they can also be numbers or other types like dates.
- Geospatial data 20: This is probably something specific to geolocation, maybe with coordinates.

So, the values Redis supports include Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes (or Mappings), and Geospatial data. There's no mention of other types mentioned in the context, so I don't need to consider those unless there's more information provided elsewhere.

I should structure my answer by listing each data type with its corresponding value as described in the context. That way, anyone reading it can understand exactly which types Redis supports and their specific definitions.

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- **Strings**: Any binary sequence.
- **Lists**: Linked lists of items, supporting any type.
- **Sets**: Unique items; no duplicates allowed.
- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but sorted in a specific order.
- **Hashes (Mappings)**: Take a key and return a value. Keys can be strings or other types like numbers or dates.
- **Geospatial data 20**: Geolocation-specific data, perhaps with coordinates.

This comprehensive list aligns with Redis' value definitions based on the provided context."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Redis supports as its value data types. From what I remember about Redis, it's mostly NoSQL, and one of its main strengths is handling unstructured or semi-structured data well. The context provided mentions some key points about Redis' data types. 

First off, the example given in the context talks about the keys and values for different structures. For instance, a list can store elements where each element can be any binary sequence, so that makes sense because lists are unordered. Similarly, a set is mentioned as having unique, sorted unsorted string elements. But wait, isn't there more to it?

I think Redis actually supports several types of collections beyond sets and lists. The key section mentions ""Values"" which include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are like dictionaries with keys), and geospatial data. So that's a comprehensive list.

But I also remember reading somewhere about Redis supporting custom data types through structures called bags and multisets. Bags allow duplicates, while multisets don't. Then there's the idea of tuples as another type, which can contain multiple values from different collections.

Putting this together, Redis should support several built-in data types. The example in the context is a good starting point, but I also need to consider any additional features or custom types they might have introduced later on. 

So, compiling all that, the supported data types for values would include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. Additionally, through structures like bags and multisets, Redis can support tuples as well. I'm not sure if geospatial data is still fully supported or if that's something specific to a newer version of Redis.

I should also check if there are any other special cases or notes about Redis' value types in the context provided. It seems the example focuses on key-value pairs, but in reality, Redis does support these structures and even more through its extensions.

In summary, while the example gives some key points, Redis actually supports several data types beyond that. The important ones are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, bags (with duplicates), multisets (without duplicates), and tuples.

Redis supports several built-in data types for values, including:

1. **Strings**: Represented as BLOBs or JSON objects but typically stored in their native form.

2. **Lists**: Store elements that can be any binary sequence. Lists are unordered.

3. **Sets**: Contain unique, sorted, unsorted string elements. Sets allow duplicates without order.

4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain order.

5. **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Map keys to values, commonly used for relationships.

6. **Bags**: Allow duplicates and store multiple collections with the same identifier.

7. **Multisets**: Do not allow duplicates and are structured as ordered lists of unique elements.

8. **Tuples**: Can contain multiple elements from different collections or even an array of tuples. They can have duplicates if a collection supports it.

These types form part of Redis' flexible data model, which allows for versatile storage solutions tailored to various use cases."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out the data types supported by Redis for storing values. I remember that Redis is a NoSQL database, which means it's good for things like sets and sequences instead of relational tables. The context provided mentions some specific data types for values.

Let me start by recalling what I know about data types in different databases. In MySQL, we have numeric types (integer, float), string types, datetime, etc., and more complex ones like bitmap indexes. In SQL, it's similarâ€”numeric, text, datetime, etc. But since Redis is NoSQL, its values are usually simpler structures.

The context mentions that for values in Redis:
- Strings
- Lists (which are linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted strings)
- Sorted Sets (so the order matters)
- Hashes, which map from one type to another
- Geospatial data of type 20, with a similarity key.

I think these cover most of the value types Redis supports. I should check if there are any other specific terms or variations they might use. For example, in some contexts, lists can also be called arrays, but that's more of an implementation detail. Similarly, sets can sometimes refer to unique sets rather than regular sets.

Also, considering common use cases for these types:
- Strings: frequently used
- Lists and arrays: useful for sequences like documents or time series data
- Sets: useful when duplicates are not allowed but order doesn't matter
- Sorted sets: important in databases where ordered operations are common
- Hashes: often used as keys, especially since they can be hashed into unique values
- Geospatial data with similarity key: which is specific to location data.

I don't recall any other types mentioned beyond these. So I think that's comprehensive based on the context provided.

The data types supported by Redis for storing values are:

1. **Strings**: The primary type, used frequently for text and alphanumeric data.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Useful for sequences where order matters but duplicates are not allowed.
3. **Sets**: Each element is unique, supporting insertion and deletion operations.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintains elements in a specific order.
5. **Hashes (Mapping Types)**: Map one type to another, often used as keys or identifiers.
6. **Geospatial Data with Similarity Key**: Represents spatial data using geohash values for similarity purposes.

These types are designed to handle various data needs efficiently, especially in NoSQL environments where simplicity and flexibility are key."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
