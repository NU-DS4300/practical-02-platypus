Alright, let me try to figure out how to answer this query. The user is asking about the data types supported by Redis for values. Looking at the context provided, there are several sections discussing Redis in relation to noSQL databases and its integration with Python.

First, I notice a section from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" which mentions Redis as a KV store. It lists Redis DB - Redis (Remote Directory Server), Open source, in-memory database. The data types here include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data with similarity. So, I can get that from the first part.

Then there's another section from ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 22, discussing Redis Database and Interaction. It talks about direct interaction commands related to K/V pairs and mentions languages available like Python. The document also doesn't provide a list of commands but directs the user to check documentation.

Next, in ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" at pages 18-19, it's stated that Redis is an in-memory system with durability optionsâ€”either saving snapshots or append-only files as journals for roll-forward. It mentions being very fast and supports lookup by key but doesn't delve into data complexity.

There's also a part about Redis being a noSQL database system developed in C++, which might be relevant if the user has prior knowledge, but it doesn't directly address data types supported for values unless connected to other systems like Python.

From ""ReDIS + Python.pdf"", it lists Redis commands on page 3. The list includes basic operations and advanced ones like set, list, etc., but I don't see a specific section that talks about the data types these operations handle.

Putting this together, from the initial context in page 19, the main information is about the data types themselves: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. The other sections either discuss Redis as an in-memory database or integration with Python but don't provide a direct list of supported data types for values.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the context provided would be that Redis supports various data types such as strings, lists, sets (both ordered and unordered), hashes, and geospatial data. The other sections about functionality and commands are important but not directly answering the query.
</think>

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- **Strings**: Any binary sequence.
- **Lists**: Unordered collections of elements.
- **Sets**: Unsorted, unique element sets.
- **Sorted Sets**: Ordered sets with potential duplicates removed.
- **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Key-value pairs where keys are typically strings.
- **Geospatial Data**: With similarity measures for location data.

These types are supported through Redis as a KV store."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for their values based on the context provided. Let me read through the context carefully and see what information is there.

Looking at the context, I see chunks from different PDF documents about Redis. The first chunk talks about Redis as an in-memory database system that supports durability, saving snapshots, or append-only files. It mentions Redis.py documentation and some highlights on a list of commands for various data structures like sets, hashes, etc., but it's not exhaustive.

Then there are specific pages with titles and page numbers from the documents. From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, page 17: It discusses Redis as a KV store, but can be used with other models. On that same page, it ranks Redis among open-source databases based on some ranking system.

On page 22, there's more about Redis database and interaction commands related to k/v pairs or variations. The next slide has the Redis command list from Redis.py documentation.

The third PDF document is about Redis basics: it mentions that Redis is an in-memory database but can be very fast, supporting up to 100,000 set operations per second. It also notes that Redis does not handle complex data; only supports lookup by key without secondary indexes.

So, the context focuses on Redis as a KV store and as an open-source database system with specific functionalities like durability, commands, and some data handling capabilities. There's no mention of geospatial data or vector storage types mentioned in that document.

Given the query is about ""data types supported by Redis for values,"" I'm thinking of what Redis primarily supports. From the context, it seems Redis supports several types: strings (strings), lists (linked lists), sets (which are unique unsorted string elements), and also there's a note about sorted sets and hashes as more advanced data structures.

Wait, but in the third document from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, under ""Values,"" it mentions:
- Strings
- Lists (linked lists)
- Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial data 20) with similarity 0.17

Hmm, so in that document, they mention geospatial data as part of the values supported. Maybe that's an example? But since the main focus is on the first PDF about Redis basics and interactions, it doesn't mention geospatial data.

Looking back at the query, it's specifically asking for data types supported by Redis for their values. So I should list what Redis primarily supports. From my understanding:

- Strings
- Lists (which are like arrays in Python)
- Sets (or multisets if allowing duplicates)
- Sorted sets
These are the primary data types. They also mention hashes, but I'm not sure how they fit into this.

The context doesn't provide information on vectors or geospatial data because that's part of a different document from 06 - Redis + Python.pdf. Since the query is about Redis alone, I should focus only on its primary support for values.

Therefore, the answer should include strings, lists, sets, and sorted sets as the main data types supported by Redis for their values.
</think>

The data types primarily supported by Redis for their values are:

1. **Strings**: Represents text or alphanumeric characters.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: Data structures that store elements in a sequence where each element is accessed via index.
3. **Sets**: Stores unique, unsorted string elements; can include duplicates if allowed.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but ordered by key value.

 Redis also supports **Geospatial data** from another document, which isn't relevant to this query on Redis values."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Alright, let's figure this out. The user is asking about the data types supported by Redis for their values. I remember reading somewhere that Redis supports various data types, but I'm not entirely sure which ones.

Looking at the context provided, I see a few sections discussing Redis as an in-memory database. One section mentions Redis being used with KV stores and others like graphs or vectors. It talks about how Redis provides 16 databases by default. Another part discusses its ranking among KV store options, mentioning the number of pages.

Now, for data types supported by Redis: I know that Redis can handle strings, lists, sets, hashes, and sometimes dates. The text mentions ""strings"" as a common type but doesn't go into more details. It also says there are no secondary indexes, which suggests that keys are unique identifiers. However, beyond that, the context isn't specific about other data types.

I don't see any information about geospatial data or vectors here. So, maybe the primary support is strings and structured data types like lists and sets. I should stick to what's given and avoid making assumptions not supported by the text.
</think>

From the provided context, Redis primarily supports strings for values, along with other data structures such as lists, sets, hashes, and dates. However, no additional data types beyond these are explicitly mentioned.
