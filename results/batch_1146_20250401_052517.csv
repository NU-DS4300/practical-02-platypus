Okay, so I have this query about AVL trees and their balancing during insertion or deletion operations. Let me try to figure out what the user is asking for.

First, the query says, ""What kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations?"" I remember that AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. So, they maintain a balance factor, which can be -1 (left-heavy), 0 (balanced), or +1 (right-heavy). When this balance factor deviates from these values during insertion or deletion, the tree needs to rebalance.

The user is asking specifically about imbalances that require multiple rotations. I think the key here is that when a node's balance factor becomes more than one or less than -one, it means we need to perform rotations. The question is about the types of such imbalances.

I recall that in AVL trees, after an insertion or deletion, there might be two consecutive imbalances on either side of a node. For example, if inserting into the left subtree creates a right-heavy imbalance, and then deleting from the right child leaves it with a left-heavy imbalance. Each time this happens, we need to perform a rotation.

Let me think about when multiple rotations are needed. I believe that in such cases, two consecutive imbalances on either side of a node require three or four rotations, respectively. For instance, if inserting into the left subtree causes the balance factor on the parent node to increase by one (becoming right-heavy), and then deleting from the right child makes its balance factor decrease by one (becoming left-heavy), we need two separate rotations—one for each imbalance.

So, in total, that's three rotations needed. I'm pretty sure about this because during insertion and deletion, each imbalance causes a rotation on either side until everything is balanced again. Therefore, the imbalances required are the ones where after inserting or deleting, the tree has left-heavy and right-heavy subtrees on either side of a node.

I should make sure there's no other scenario that requires multiple rotations beyond this. Maybe some edge cases? I don't think so because the standard AVL tree rebalancing process involves fixing each imbalance one by one until the entire structure is balanced.

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations are those where two consecutive nodes (on either side of a given node) have balance factors that differ from the maximum allowed (-1). When this happens during insertion or deletion operations, the tree must perform three or four rotations to restore the balance. Specifically, if one insertion causes a right-heavy imbalance and then a deletion restores it on the other side, multiple rotations are needed.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what an AVL tree is. It's a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced and operations like searching, insertion, and deletion can be done efficiently.

The question is about imbalances that require multiple rotations to fix. I remember that an AVL tree needs to maintain its balance after insertions or deletions because a perfectly balanced tree is best for efficiency. So when things aren't perfectly balanced, we need adjustments.

I think the key here is something called ""rotations."" In binary search trees, sometimes you have imbalances where the left subtree's depth exceeds the right subtree's, and vice versa. This can happen after an insertion or deletion that breaks the balance.

Wait, I remember that when this happens, you might need one or two rotations to rebalance the tree. For example, if inserting a new node causes the right subtree to be deeper than the left, we need to pull nodes from the right side up to the root and then insert back. That would require multiple steps.

But what about other imbalances? Like if both subtrees are too deep or have some other imbalance? I think it's possible that two rotations might be needed in such cases. But maybe sometimes only one rotation is enough, depending on where the problem is located.

I'm pretty sure that each time there's an imbalance, you can fix it by rotating either the left subtree up to its parent or the right subtree down from its parent. So two rotations are sufficient for certain kinds of imbalances, but I need to confirm that.

Also, I recall that this process ensures that the tree remains balanced and doesn't require any other adjustments beyond these rotations. This is crucial because if you don't balance it, the performance can degrade significantly with each operation.

I think I should summarize: In an AVL tree, when insertions or deletions cause one side of the tree to become too deep compared to the other, you might need two rotations to rebalance it. One rotation could fix a single imbalance, and another rotation would handle any resulting issue from that first correction.

In an AVL tree, imbalances caused by insertions or deletions typically require multiple rotations to correct. Specifically:

1. **Single Imbalance**: If one side becomes too deep compared to the other, you might need just one rotation. For example, if inserting a node makes the right subtree deeper, you can rotate left nodes up and insert back, correcting the imbalance with one rotation.

2. **Two Rotations for Two Imbalances**: When both subtrees are excessively deep or have some imbalance, two rotations may be necessary. This could involve rotating left to correct the first issue and then possibly rotating right if needed, ensuring that each operation maintains the balance.

Thus, in cases of two imbalances, you might need up to two rotations. However, one rotation is sufficient for a single imbalance."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause it to require more than one rotation. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This helps maintain balance and ensures that operations like insertion, deletion, and search are efficient.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree happen when one subtree is significantly taller than the other, violating the height difference rule. But how does this lead to needing multiple rotations?

Let me consider different types of imbalances:

1. **Left Rotation Only**: If a node has more left subtree depth than right, a single left rotation can balance it. Similarly, if the right side is too deep, a single right rotation will fix that.

2. **Right Rotation Only**: The same logic applies for right rotations when the tree becomes too skewed to the right.

3. **Both Left and Right Rotation**: In cases where both subtrees are imbalanced—left too deep and right too deep—it might require one left rotation followed by one right, or vice versa. For example, if inserting a new node causes the root's left subtree to be deeper than the root, then I need a left rotation there. After that, if the root's right subtree is now deeper, another rotation on the root might fix it.

I should also think about an extreme case where one side is two levels deep while the other is just one. This would require at least two rotations to balance. One rotation might correct the imbalance in one subtree and then another to fix the newly imbalanced part.

Wait, but I'm not sure if any single rotation can handle all cases. Maybe sometimes you need more than one, like when both sides are deep, requiring a double rotation. That makes sense because each rotation only addresses one side at a time.

So putting it together: The key is that an AVL tree requires multiple rotations to balance after certain imbalances, especially when both left and right subtrees are too deep relative to the root.
</think>

The type of imbalance in an AVL tree that requires multiple rotations occurs when both the left and right child subtrees become significantly unbalanced. This situation necessitates a sequence of two rotations: first correcting the imbalance on one side, followed by addressing the new imbalance on the other side. 

Answer: An AVL tree requires multiple rotations to balance after imbalances where both the left and right subtree depths are excessively large relative to each other, necessitating two separate rotations to restore balance.

**Answer**: An AVL tree requires multiple rotations when both left and right subtrees become too unbalanced, needing two rotations to correct."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
