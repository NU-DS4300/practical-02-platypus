Okay, I need to figure out which data types Redis supports for storing values. The user provided a context that talks about various types in the Redis Data Types Keys section of a PDF. Let me try to recall what I know about Redis and its data types.

First, from the context, it mentions that Values can be strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, or geospatial data with similarity values. But wait, does Redis include geospatial data? The text doesn't specify this for Redis, so maybe I should assume it's beyond the basic scope unless told otherwise.

So focusing on the basics: Strings are definitely a key type in Redis. Lists, which are linked lists of strings or other types, and sets, which can be unique or non-unique. There's also a Sorted Set, which is like a set but maintains order. Then there's Hashes, which map keys to values as strings, though they don't contain actual data.

Additionally, I remember that in some contexts, Redis might have additional types for more specialized use cases. For example, it can handle geospatial data using the ""geohash"" type with specific similarity values like 0.31. But since the context provided doesn't mention this, maybe I shouldn't include that unless the query specifically asks about it.

I should also consider if there are other types I might be missing. From my knowledge base, Redis has a variety of collections: Set, List, Dictionary (which is an ordered list), Keyed Set, and Sorted Set. These correspond to the data structures in the keys section provided in the context.

So putting it all together, the primary data types for values are strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes. Geospatial support might be an extension beyond this query.

The primary data types supported by Redis for storing values include:

- **Strings**: Any binary sequence (strings) used in operations like lookups or concatenations.

- **Lists**: An ordered collection of strings or other types, allowing duplicates and order based on insertion.

- **Sets**: A collection of unique elements. Sets can be unordered and allow duplicates if the underlying structure supports it.

- **Sorted Sets**: A specialized set that maintains its elements in a sorted order, useful for operations like inclusion checks efficiently.

- **Hashes (Dictionaries)**: Maps keys to values as strings, used for key-based lookups or when exact data storage is needed.

Additionally, Redis might support geospatial data with types like ""geohash"" for spatial data, but this isn't included in the basic scope of value types."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values. From the context provided, it mentions that Redis has several types. Let me go through them one by one.

First, the values can be any binary sequence. So that's probably the general idea, but I should make sure about each specific type.

Next, there are lists which are linked lists of elements. They're ordered and allow duplicates. That makes sense because in programming, you often need a list where order matters.

Then, sets. The context says they're unique and unsorted. So Redis can create a set with only one occurrence of each element, like using an array and removing duplicates. I should note that sets don't allow duplicates.

Sorted sets seem to have the elements in a specific order, so you might sort them later if needed. That's useful for ordered data storage or retrieval.

Hashes are functions that map strings to strings. They can store keys-value pairs. Examples include md5, sha256, etc. They're great for storing passwords securely because they're unkeyed but deterministic based on the input.

 geospatial data with similarity is mentioned as 0.31. I'm not sure about the exact value here, but I can infer it's a way to store geospatial coordinates and perform spatial queries. Maybe something like GeoJSON or similar formats. It's probably used for geographic information systems (GIS) where precise location-based operations are needed.

Are there any other types? The context stops there, so probably these five: binary sequences, list, set, sorted set, hash. I'll make a note to include them in the answer.

Redis supports several data types for values, each with specific characteristics:

1. **Binary Sequences**: These are general-purpose and can hold any binary sequence, useful for storing arbitrary data.

2. **List**: A linked list of elements that are ordered, allowing duplicates. Useful for maintaining order without deduplication.

3. **Set**: A collection of unique elements in an unsorted manner. Duplicate values are not allowed within a set.

4. **Sorted Set**: Similar to a set but maintains the order of elements, making it suitable for sorted data storage or retrieval.

5. **Hashes (Function Data Types)**: These use functions like md5, sha256, etc., which map input strings to output values. They are commonly used for storing securely stored passwords due to their unkeyed nature but deterministic results from a specific input.

Additionally, Redis supports geospatial data through formats with similarity 0.31, likely geospatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) for spatial queries in GIS contexts."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Alright, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.

The context mentions that in the section about Data Types, it lists several categories: Keys, Values, and some examples like Strings, Lists, Sets, etc., with a note on Geospatial data being more complicated. But I'm focusing on the values here.

So looking back at the context, under ""Values,"" it says:
- Strings
- Lists (which are linked lists)
- Sets (which are unique unsorted string elements)
- Sorted Sets (ordered sets of unique strings)
- Hashes (which convert input to output hashes)

It also mentions that for Geospatial data, there's a complexity factor involving similarity with geohashing.

Putting it all together, the data types Redis supports for values include Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, and Hashes. I should make sure to mention all of these in my answer.
</think>

The data types Redis supports for values are:

1. **Strings**: Any sequence of characters or symbols.
2. **Lists**: Unsorted collections where elements can be of any type, including strings.
3. **Sets**: Collections of unique elements that cannot have duplicates; they are unordered and support membership testing in O(1) time.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain order, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations with a time complexity of O(n) for these operations.
5. **Hashes (Hash Tables)**: Dictionaries that map keys to values using hash functions, providing average constant-time complexity for insertions, lookups, deletions, and other operations.

These data types in Redis are designed to handle both simple and complex data structures efficiently."|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
