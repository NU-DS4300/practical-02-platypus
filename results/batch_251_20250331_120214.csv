Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for values. From the context provided, it's all about Redis being an in-memory database system and a client-side Python library called redis. Let me go through each point step by step.

First, on page 19 of that PDF, they mention Redis as an in-memory database system. They talk about durability—basically, you can save snapshots to disk at specific intervals or use a journal for changes that can be rolled forward if there's a failure. That makes sense because it emphasizes the persistence aspect.

Then on page 18, it says Redis supports durability with either saving snapshots to disk or using an append-only file as a journal. The journal is like a log of changes and can be used for roll-forward operations in case something goes wrong. So that's interesting because some databases are persistent by default, others might not.

Page 19 also mentions Redis being open-source, in-memory, sometimes called a data structure store. It says Redis primarily functions as a KV store but can be used with various models like graphs, spatial, text search, etc. That gives a bit more flexibility depending on the use case.

Moving to page 17, they talk about Redis as an in-memory database and mention that it's primarily a KV store but supports other models. They list some examples: graph databases, full-text search, vector spaces, time series data. So even though it's mainly for key-value pairs, it can handle more complex data structures.

Then on page 22, they say Redis provides 16 default databases by default and no other name is associated with them. That means if you run redis, the default database will be one of these 16. I think this is important because depending on how you set it up, you might have different environments.

Page 23 describes that Redis allows direct interaction through commands for setting and getting KV pairs or variations. So you can use a variety of commands to manipulate data like adding entries, retrieving them, updating, etc. This makes it a versatile client library.

The subsequent pages discuss the popularity of Redis as an in-memory database because of its speed—supporting up to 100,000 set operations per second. That's pretty impressive for databases. It also mentions the rich collection of commands and supports various data types like strings, lists (linked lists), sets, sorted sets, hashes (which are mappings from keys to values), and geospatial data.

Looking back at the query: ""Name the data types supported by Redis for values."" From page 19 and 23, I can gather that Redis supports several data types including strings, but also lists, which are like arrays; sets of unique elements without duplicates; sorted sets which maintain order; hashes—strings mapped to other strings; and geospatial data with similarity. These are all binary sequences, so they fit the description.

I should make sure there's no mention of other types in the provided context. The PDF only talks about these specific types for values. So I don't think I missed any. Therefore, Redis supports a range from strings to more complex data structures like geospatial data.

Redis supports various data types for its values, which include:

1. **Strings**: Used as keys or labels.
2. **Lists (Linked Lists)**: A sequence of elements where each element is an object that can be accessed in order.
3. **Sets (Unique Unsorted String Elements)**: Collection of unique elements without duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain insertion order.
5. **Hashes (Key-Value Pairs)**: Mappings from keys to values, which are strings or other data types.
6. **Geospatial Data 20**: Data representing locations with similarity metrics between points.

These data types cover both simple and complex structures, making Redis suitable for a wide range of applications, especially those needing in-memory performance."|redis|bge-m3|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis. From what I remember, Redis is an in-memory database system that can be used as a server or client. It's known for being fast and having good performance.

Looking at the context provided, there are some pages related to Redis, like a PDF document on NoSQL databases and another on Redis-py, which is a Python library. In those documents, I see several sections talking about Redis data types.

On page 19, it mentions that Redis supports various types of data. The first bullet point says the ""Values: - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets (unique unsorted string elements) - Sorted Sets - Geospatial data 20)"" with similarity 0.31. So, from this section, I can see that Redis supports strings, lists, sets, and geospatial data.

The next pages talk about Redis being a KV store but also being used for other models like graphs, spatial, full text search, etc. But the key point here is the types of values it handles. The main ones mentioned are strings, lists, sets, and geospatial data.

I should double-check if there are any other specific data types Redis supports beyond these. I don't recall any other sections that mention additional data types in this context. So, based on what's provided, Redis primarily handles strings, lists, sets, and geospatial data for values in its KV store format.

Wait, I also see a note on page 23 about direct interaction commands related to K/V pairs. That probably relates to the command-line tools like phpredis or redis-cli, but those are for interacting with Redis. The actual types of data would still be covered by the initial sections mentioned earlier.

So putting it all together, Redis supports strings, lists (which are ordered collections), sets (which are unordered and unique elements), and geospatial data (like coordinates). There's also mention of Sorted Sets which are ordered sets, but I think that's already covered under lists.

I don't see any other specific data types mentioned here. Therefore, the answer should include these four data types.
</think>

Redis supports several primary data types for values, primarily:

1. **Strings**: Used to store text data or alphanumeric strings.
2. **Lists**: Similar to arrays in other languages, they are ordered collections of elements.
3. **Sets**: Unordered, unique sets of string elements.
4. **Geospatial Data**: Including geospatial coordinates (latitude and longitude).

These types provide the foundational structure for storing and managing data efficiently in Redis."|pgvector|bge-m3|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many data types Redis supports for storing values and list them all. I remember from the context provided that Redis has a specific structure of data types it handles. Let me go through each section again carefully.

First, looking at the ""Redis Data Types Keys"" section on page 19, the text explains that Redis is an in-memory database system. It mentions durability with two main methods: saving snapshots to disk or using append-only files for a journal that can be rolled forward if there's a failure. The text also notes that Redis supports various data types like strings, lists (which are linked lists), sets (which are unique and unsorted string elements), sorted sets, hashes (which map strings to other strings), and geospatial data with similarity metrics.

On page 18, it mentions that Redis has a rich collection of commands. The section on ""Redis DB"" states that Redis is primarily a KV store but can be used in various models like graph, spatial, full text search, vector, time series, etc., and it doesn't handle complex data structures beyond the basic lookups by key.

Looking at the ""Redis Database and Interaction"" section on page 22, it says Redis provides multiple databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. There are no other names associated with Redis, which makes sense since it's a distributed system. It also mentions that Redis is maintained by the company itself, has a GitHub repository called redis/redis-py, and the standard Python client for Redis is redis-py.

Putting all this together, I can list out all the data types Redis supports. From the first paragraph, the main categories are strings, lists (which are essentially arrays), sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data with similarity metrics. The second paragraph doesn't add any new data types beyond what's already covered.

So, to summarize, Redis supports the following data types:
- Strings
- Lists
- Sets
- Sorted Sets
- Hashes (maps)
- Geospatial Data with Similarity

I don't think I missed any other data types from the provided context. The section about geospatial data mentions similarity metrics, which is another way of handling data but underlies the basic data type support.
</think>

 Redis supports the following data types for storing values:

1. **Strings**: Used to store text, numbers, and other textual representations.
2. **Lists (Arrays)**: Data structures that allow sequential insertion and access, with no specific order except insertion.
3. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements, used for maintaining distinct values without duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain elements in a sorted order based on their natural ordering.
5. **Hashes (Maps)**: Data structures that map keys (strings) to values and do not have a defined insertion order.
6. **Geospatial Data with Similarity Metrics**: Supports geospatial data where similarity is calculated using metrics like Hamming distance or Cosine distance.

These data types are designed to efficiently handle various storage needs, from simple lookups to more complex operations involving spatial or similar data."|chroma|bge-m3|1000|100|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
