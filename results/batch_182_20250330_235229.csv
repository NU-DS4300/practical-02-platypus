"Based on the provided context, I don't have any information that directly answers your question about AVL trees or their rotation requirements. The context appears to be related to data replication, database consistency, and non-relational databases, but it doesn't mention AVL trees specifically.

Therefore, my answer is ""I don't know"" as I don't have the relevant information in this context. If you're looking for information on AVL tree rotations or imbalances, I recommend searching for specific resources or asking a different question that's more directly related to your topic of interest."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The provided context is about data replication, consistency, observations on arrays and linked lists, binary search trees, and optimistic concurrency, but it does not mention AVL trees or any related information. Therefore, I am unable to answer the query accurately.|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

I don't know. The context appears to be about NoSQL databases, data replication, and relational databases, but it doesn't mention AVL trees or any related concepts. Therefore, I'm not able to provide an answer to your query.|chroma|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
