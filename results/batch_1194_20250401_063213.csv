Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what an AVL tree is. It's a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced and operations like search, insert, and delete can be performed efficiently.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree occur when the heights of the left and right subtrees of a node don't balance each other out within this difference of one. There are different types of imbalances that cause rotations:

1. **Left-Left (LL) Imbalance**: This happens when both the left child's height is greater than or equal to the node's height, and the node's height is greater than or equal to the right child's height. In this case, moving a node from the left subtree down would require two rotations: one left rotation at the parent node and another left rotation at the grandparent node.

2. **Right-Right (RR) Imbalance**: This occurs when both the right child's height is greater than or equal to the node's height, and the node's height is greater than or equal to the left child's height. Similarly, this also requires two rotations: one right rotation at the parent node and another right rotation at the grandparent node.

3. **Right-Left (RL) Imbalance**: Here, the right subtree's height is greater than or equal to the node's height, but the left subtree's height is less than the node's height. This can cause a single left rotation because moving a node from the right side requires only one rotation at the parent level.

4. **Left-Right (LR) Imbalance**: This situation has its own imbalance and also typically requires a single right rotation. It's when both the left and right subtrees are less balanced than each other, necessitating a single rotation to balance.

So, based on these points, imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations are either Left-Left (LL) or Right-Right (RR) imbalances. Each of these requires two rotations: one at the parent and another at the grandparent node. The RL and LR imbalances can be fixed with a single rotation.

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations are **Left-Left (LL)** and **Right-Right (RR)** imbalances. Each of these requires two rotations: one at the parent level and another at the grandparent level.

**Answer:** Imbalances requiring multiple rotations in an AVL tree include Left-Left (LL) and Right-Right (RR) imbalances, which each require two rotations."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause multiple rotations. Let me start by understanding what an AVL tree is and what imbalances are.

An AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one for every node. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which keeps operations like insertion, deletion, and search efficient with time complexity O(log n).

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree occur when this balance condition is violated. So, if a node's left subtree is significantly taller than its right subtree or vice versa, it's considered an imbalance.

I remember that to restore the height difference of 1, you need one rotation. But what causes multiple rotations? Let me think about different scenarios.

First, in a perfect tree where all subtrees are exactly balanced, inserting a new node can cause the tree to become unbalanced on both sides. For example, adding a node to the left subtree might make it taller than the right by two levels, while adding to the right could also cause a similar issue. In such cases, you have multiple imbalances that require two rotations to correct.

Another situation is when an insertion causes a chain of nodes to become unbalanced. For instance, inserting into the root's right child might make it too tall on one side, but then further up in the tree could also cause imbalance. This would lead to requiring more than two rotations to balance the entire tree.

I should consider both cases where there are multiple imbalances and where they are all resolved with a single rotation. For example, inserting into the root's left and right children each create an imbalance on different sides, necessitating separate rotations. Alternatively, when inserting a node causes the root itself to have imbalances on either side, again requiring two rotations.

Additionally, if there are multiple nodes that need rebalancing beyond just their immediate parents, it could require more than one rotation per node. This might involve multiple levels of adjustments, each needing its own rotation.

In summary, imbalances in an AVL tree that result from inserting into both the root's left and right children would require two rotations to correct. Similarly, inserting a node that causes imbalance on higher up nodes would also necessitate more than one rotation.

Answer: When both the root's left and right subtrees are unbalanced due to insertions or deletions, two rotations are required to rebalance the tree."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees. AVL stands for Adaptable Vertical List and it's a self-balancing binary search tree. The key thing is that the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This balance ensures that the tree remains efficient, like O(log n) time complexity for operations.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree happen when the tree violates this property. So, during insertions or deletions, the tree might become unbalanced because it can't maintain the heights of the left and right subtrees as balanced as they should be. This imbalance causes a problem where certain operations take longer than expected.

The question is about imbalances that require multiple rotations to fix. Rotations are changes in the structure of the tree that help rebalance it again. For example, if inserting a new node makes the left subtree too heavy (too tall), we might need to move some nodes from the right subtree up higher to balance it out.

I remember something about certain specific imbalances requiring more than one rotation. Let me think: when you have two consecutive insertions where each insertion leads to an imbalance, maybe that causes a problem with multiple rotations needed. For example, inserting into the right subtree of a node and then the left subtree might both cause issues if not handled correctly.

Wait, I think when you have an AVL tree that becomes unbalanced because of two consecutive insertions, especially in certain sequences, it can require more than one rotation to restore balance. Let me consider an example: inserting into the right child first could make its subtree too heavy, which would require a left rotation on that node to bring it back to balance. But if the previous insertion also affected something else, maybe another rotation is needed afterward.

So, I'm pretty sure that when you have two consecutive insertions or deletions in specific sequences (like after an insertion that makes the tree unbalanced by moving nodes from right to left), it can cause multiple rotations. For instance, inserting into a node's right child first might make its subtree too heavy, requiring a left rotation on that node. But if another insertion occurs later, perhaps it affects the parent node in such a way that another rotation is needed.

Alternatively, thinking about deletion operations: when deleting from a node and its children are unbalanced, multiple rotations could be necessary to rebalance after both insertions and deletes have been handled.

Another thought: sometimes, when you delete from a node's right child first, it might affect the parent node in a way that needs another rotation. So, perhaps two consecutive operations (insert or delete) on different subtrees can cause multiple rotations.

I should probably check if there are specific cases where this happens more than once. For example, inserting into both left and right children of a node in a certain order might require moving nodes up twice to restore balance. Or maybe when deleting from the root after some insertions, it could lead to two rotations.

I think I'm getting closer. The answer is that imbalances requiring multiple rotations are typically caused by sequences where inserting or deleting operations affect two different subtrees of the same node in a way that makes their heights differ by more than one, and these can cause multiple left or right rotations.

Wait, another example: when an insertion causes the parent node's subtree height to increase by more than one level, it might require moving nodes from its children up. But if there was already a situation where both children were unbalanced, maybe two rotations are needed. Or perhaps after inserting into one child and then another, it creates a new imbalance that requires multiple steps.

I'm starting to think that the key imbalances that need multiple rotations are those where the insertion or deletion causes the parent node's height to increase by more than one level. Since each rotation can only adjust the heights of two nodes (one up and one down), sometimes you might have to perform a second rotation to fix it.

I should probably look up an example, but since I don't have access right now, I'll rely on what I know. The main idea is that certain imbalances involve sequences where inserting into one part of the tree affects another part in a way that requires multiple rotations to rebalance both.
</think>

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations are typically caused by sequences where inserting or deleting operations cause the parent node's height to increase by more than one level. This imbalance necessitates moving nodes from different subtrees up, leading to two rotations:

1. **Insertion into Left Child First**: Inserting into a node's left child can make its subtree too heavy, requiring a left rotation on that node.

2. **Insertion into Right Child First**: Similarly, inserting into the right child first might cause an imbalance if it now makes the parent node's height exceed one level, necessitating another rotation to rebalance both subtrees.

3. **Delete Operations in Specific Sequences**: Deleting from a node and then deleting from its children can lead to multiple rotations needed after each operation.

In conclusion, multiple rotations are required when inserting into two different nodes' subtrees simultaneously or when the balance is disrupted by deletions in specific sequences. These operations ensure that both left and right heights remain within one level difference."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
