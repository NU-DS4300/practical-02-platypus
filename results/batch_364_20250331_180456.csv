Alright, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j. I remember that Neo4j is a graph database that uses a specific kind of SQL called Cypher for querying data.

The context provided mentions something about the development timeline. It talks about the creation in 2011 under the name ""Cypher"" and refers to it as a ""graph query language."" The part I'm focusing on is where it's developed, which is from 2011 onwards. 

Looking at the specific query: ""When was neo4j's graph query language invented?"" The answer provided earlier says that Neo4j's Cypher was created in 2011. That makes sense because the context mentions ""Cypher"" being introduced in 2011 and referred to as the 'graph query language.' So, putting it all together, the time frame is indeed 2011.

I think I might have missed a step before, but according to the provided information, there's no other time mentioned. The main point was that Cypher was introduced in 2011 and referred to as Neo4j's graph query language. So, the answer should be 2011.

TheCypher language, used by Neo4j, was introduced in 2011.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me look at the context provided. The text mentions that Neo4j is a graph database created in 2011. It also talks about Cypher as the graph query language and mentions some plugins like APOC for processing graphs efficiently. 

So, the key points here are that Neo4j was developed around 2011. The context specifically states that the goal was to create a SQL-equivalent language for graph databases. I'm not sure when exactly Cypher was introduced, but it seems like Cypher became part of Neo4j in that same year or just before. 

I don't recall any other details about when Cypher itself was created; the context only mentions Cypher being used within the Neo4j framework and mentioned as a tool for graph queries. Therefore, based on what's provided, Neo4j introduced Cypher around 2011. The answer should reflect that information accurately.

Neo4j was introduced with the Cypher query language in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. The user provided a context where the focus is on the evolution of the Cypher query language within Neo4j, mentioning versions from 2011 onwards. The document specifically talks about the introduction of APOC plugins and other functionalities, but it doesn't mention any changes or additions to the query language itself.

Hmm, since the provided context doesn't discuss the creation or origin of Neo4j's Cypher language, I can't find specific details there. It only gives a timeline of when the plugin and its features were added. So, based on what's in the context, it seems the answer isn't there.

I should consider if there's any other information outside the provided text that might hint at when Neo4j's query language was developed. But since I'm limited to the given context, I can't gather more details. Therefore, I'll say that I don't know because the context doesn't provide the answer.
