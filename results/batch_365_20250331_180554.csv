Okay, so I need to answer the query about the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context. Let me see what the context says.

From the context, there's a PDF section starting at page 19. It lists Redis Data Types Keys. The specific information given is that Values are Strings, Lists (which are like arrays), Sets (unsorted and unique elements), Sorted Sets, Geospatial data with similarity, and hashes mapped from strings to strings.

So the user asked for the data types supported by Redis for values. Looking at the context, under the ""Values"" section, it says: - Strings - Lists (linked lists) - Sets - Sorted Sets - Geospatial data 20) with similarity 0.31

I should make sure I understand each of these terms correctly. For example, a list in Redis is an ordered collection, and since they can't have duplicates, that's why it's described as ""unsorted."" A set is unordered but unique elements, so the key point here might be that Redis doesn't support sets with order or duplicates because sets are meant for unique elements. However, sometimes people still use them if needed.

The geospatial data section mentions similarity 0.31. I'm not entirely sure what the ""similarity"" part refers to, but it likely means that when dealing with geospatial data, using hash functions (which have a certain degree of collision) is common because they can approximate distances or similarities between points on the sphere.

So putting this together, the main values Redis supports for keys are Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, and Geospatial data. Each type has its own characteristics and use cases, so it's important to mention them clearly in the answer.

The data types supported by Redis for values include:

- **Strings**: The basic type used to store text or numeric strings.
- **Lists**: An ordered collection of items where duplicates are not allowed.
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements, often used for keys that require quick lookups.
- **Sorted Sets**: Ordered versions of sets, useful when order matters but uniqueness is maintained.
- **Geospatial Data with similarity 0.31**: A specific type designed for geospatial data where hash functions have a certain degree of similarity.

These types are fundamental to Redis's architecture and its use as a NoSQL database."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to answer this query about the data types supported by Redis for values based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.

The context mentions that in the section ""Values,"" Redis supports several types: Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, and Geospatial data. Wait, it also lists 20 points under Geospatial data 20, but I don't think those are relevant for the query. The main question is about the values, so I should focus on the list of value types.

The user also mentioned that in the text above, the data types include strings, lists, sets, etc., and it's labeled as ""Values."" So putting that together, the values supported by Redis are: Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, and Geospatial data. 

I think I should list these clearly for the answer. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything else from the context. There's no mention of dates or other types mentioned after ""Values."" So those aren't included.

Wait, just to double-check: The values are Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, and Geospatial data 20. Yeah, that seems right. So I'll structure my answer to list each value type as specified.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to name the data types supported by Redis for values based on the provided context. First, I'll read through the context carefully.

The context mentions several data types under ""Values:"" section with an example of a geospatial dataset. It lists strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes as values in Redis. That's the main part to focus on.

I need to make sure I capture all these points accurately. The user is asking specifically about Redis data types for values, so I should ensure I don't include anything from other sections like the keys or structure mentioned later.

Also, since the query doesn't mention ""I don't know,"" my answer can directly address the values section without needing additional context about the structure of Redis data types. I'll stick to what's given in the context to provide the correct and accurate information.
