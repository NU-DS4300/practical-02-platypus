Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j and related technologies. 

From the context provided, it seems that Neo4j is a graph database developed by Oz Geoffrey. The document mentions Cypher, which is their graph query language. It also talks about various features like APOC Plug-in, Graph Data Science Plugin, and distributed computing support.

I remember reading that Neo4j was created around 2013. I think it started with some initial work on the database system but then evolved into a full-featured graph database later on. The Cypher query language would have been part of this development process, which likely began before or during this period.

Looking at the documents provided, one mentions Neo4j's system being created around 2013, while another points to ""DS 4300 Neo4j Mark Fontenot, PhD Northeastern University Material referenced from Graph Algorithms - Practical Examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j by Needham and Hodler (O’Reilly Press, 2019)"". This material references the introduction of Neo4j but doesn't explicitly state when it was invented.

The other document about ""A Graph Database System"" says that Neo4j supports transactional and analytical processing with various types of indexing and ACID compliance. It also mentions distributed computing support from similar tools like CosmoDB or Neptune, which are no-sql databases.

Putting this together, the creation of Neo4j itself must be prior to 2013, but its graph query language Cypher was likely introduced during the development phase. The exact year when Cypher was invented is probably not explicitly stated in the provided context, so I can only infer it started before 2013 based on other information about Neo4j's history.

I also notice that the introduction of Neo4j as a graph database system itself occurred around 2013. The Cypher language would have been part of this early development towards later features like APOC Plug-in and distributed computing support. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Neo4j's graph query language was invented during its early years before becoming a full graph database.
</think>

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was introduced during the early development of the system around 2013. The creation of Neo4j itself occurred prior to this time, with the system beginning to support transactional and analytical processing as part of its initial features. While the exact year when Cypher was first introduced is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that Cypher was part of Neo4j's early development towards integrating advanced graph processing capabilities like APOC Plug-in and distributed computing support.

**Answer:** Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was introduced during its early development phase before becoming a full-featured graph database. The system began supporting transactional and analytical processing in 2013 as part of its introduction."|redis|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, I see several documents and references aboutNeo4j, but most of them discuss its features and use cases. 

First, looking at ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Cypher - A Query Language for Graph Databases created in 2011 - Goal: SQL-equivalent language for graph databases..."" it mentions that Cypher was created in 2011 and is used to provide a visual way of matching patterns and relationships in graphs. 

Then there's another document titled ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011..."". This clearly states that Cypher was introduced in 2011 as a way to create a visual and efficient way to express queries on graphs. 

Since the context provided only discusses how Neo4j is used but not its history, I can't find any mention of the actual invention date of Cypher itself. However, based on the documents about Neo4j, it seems that Cypher, which was introduced in 2011, was developed by Neo4j. 

So, putting this together, Neo4j's graph query language, which is Cypher, was invented around 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was introduced in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented. From the context provided, there are several documents and pages talking about Neo4j and its various components. Let me go through each document to see if any mention the invention of Cypher.

Starting with ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011)"". This page mentions that Cypher was created in 2011. That seems like a solid piece of information.

Then there's a document titled ""From 07 - Document DBs and Mongo.pdf (page 9, chunk MongoDB Atlas released in 2016 → documentdb as a service)"". It doesn't mention anything about Cypher being created or invented, just about MongoDB and its development timeline. So maybe that's not relevant.

Another document is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 11, chunk Adding an Edge with No Variable Names CREATE (:User {name: ""Alice"", birthPlace: ""Paris""}) CREATE (:User {name: ""Bob"", birthPlace: ""London""}) MATCH (alice)-[:KNOWS {since: “2022-12-01”}]->(bob) 12 Note: Relationships are directed in neo4j.)"". This is more about how nodes and edges work in Neo4j, but it doesn't discuss the invention of Cypher.

The document ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 20, chunk Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011)"" again repeats that Cypher was created in 2011. It also says that Cypher is a visual way to match patterns and relationships using nodes.

There's another document about MongoDB, which I already mentioned earlier. It doesn't mention Cypher, so it's probably not relevant here.

The page from ""From 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 4, chunk NoSQL first used in 1998 by Carlo Strozzi to describe his relational database system that did not use SQL."" mentions that noSQL was developed earlier than Neo4j. But this is about the history of non-relational databases, not Cypher's invention.

The document ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 0, chunk DS 4300 Neo4j Mark Fontenot, PhD Northeastern University Material referenced from Graph Algorithms - Practical Examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j by Needham and hodler (O’Reilly Press, 2019))"" again talks about the graph algorithms but doesn't mention Cypher's origin.

So looking through all the documents, the only one that directly mentions the creation of Cypher is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011)"". Therefore, Cypher was invented around 2011.
</think>

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented in 2011. This document provides the most relevant information regarding the creation of Cypher within the context provided.

**Answer:** Cypher was invented in 2011."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
