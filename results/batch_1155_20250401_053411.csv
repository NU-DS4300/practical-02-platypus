Okay, so I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for storing values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and noSQL databases.

From what I remember, Redis has a set of built-in data types that it uses for various operations like sets, multisets, lists, etc. The context provided mentions that the Values section includes strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and geospatial data. So maybe those are the main ones for values.

I also remember that in Redis, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. But wait, when you want to store multiple identical items without duplicates, it's better to use a list instead. Lists can contain duplicates because they're ordered. However, sets specifically don't allow duplicates and are unsorted.

The context says Values: Strings, Lists (linked lists), Sets (unique unsorted string elements). So that would cover the basic types Redis uses for value storage.

But I also know that Redis supports other data types beyond these. For example, there's the concept of a key-value pair where each key can be a binary sequence and paired with any type of value. However, in this context, we're specifically talking about the values themselves, not the keys.

So if someone is using Redis for their application, they might use various types like integers, booleans, etc., as well as strings, lists, sets, hashes, or geospatial data. The key difference is that Redis doesn't enforce these types; it's up to the user to choose appropriate types based on their needs.

Putting this together, I think the main supported values in Redis are strings, lists, sets, and geospatial types with similarity. Geospatial data is a bit more specific because it involves coordinates or addresses, but it's still within the same value category as standard data types.

I should make sure that these align with what I know about Redis' documentation. The context mentions these points for Value Types, which seems to fit my understanding. So yes, those are the primary data types Redis supports.

The data types supported by Redis for storing values include:

1. **Strings**: Basic string operations and comparisons.
2. **Lists**: Ordered collections that can contain duplicates, supporting sets but allowing both unique and duplicate entries due to their ordered nature.
3. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements, ideal for avoiding duplicates.
4. **Sorted Sets**: Ordered collection with no duplicates, useful for maintaining an order after insertion.
5. **Geospatial Data (with similarity)**: Coordinates or address-based data, supporting geospatial calculations and comparisons.

These types are versatile and can be used with keys of any binary sequence type in your application, though their choice depends on the specific needs of your use case."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out the data types in Redis that support values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Redis and its data types.

From the context provided, there's a section on Redis Data Types Keys, which lists several data types such as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, etc., along with their specific definitions. The query is asking for the names of these data types, but specifically mentioning that it's about values rather than keys.

Wait, I should make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The context talks about ""Values"" in the section on Redis Data Types Keys. So maybe the query is a bit ambiguous—does it mean to include the keys or just the values? That could change the answer.

If it were asking for the data types that are used as keys, then the list would be:

- Strings
- Character Set (which is similar to strings)
- Hashes (though I think they're different from regular hashes)
- BLOBs because they're related to JSON storage and can contain any binary data.

But in the query, it's specifying ""values,"" so maybe the focus is on what's being stored or used as data. In a database context, values would typically refer to the fields that are associated with records, like columns in a table, but since this is about NoSQL databases, it's more about the nodes.

In a NoSQL store like Redis, the primary data structure is an array (like MongoDB), which can contain key-value pairs. So the ""values"" here would be the actual elements stored, while keys are identifiers to those values.

So looking back at Redis's data types, the values we're interested in include:

- Strings
- Lists
- Sets
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial Data (with similarity)
- Hashes

But wait, does the context mention anything about hashes? Yes, it lists them under ""Values: - Hashes (string → string) with specific characteristics like uniqueness and precision.""

So putting that together, if the query is strictly about values as fields or entities being stored in a NoSQL structure, Redis's data types for values would include strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, geospatial data, and hashes.

I should also consider whether BLOBs are included. Since BLOBs can store JSON-like objects, they might be considered part of the ""geospatial"" category because they can contain complex data structures like arrays or dictionaries.

Therefore, the data types supported by Redis for values would cover strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, geospatial (including BLOBs), and hashes. I should make sure to mention each of these clearly.

The data types in Redis that support values are:

- Strings
- Character Set (which can be considered a type of string)
- Lists
- Sets
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial Data (including BLOBs, which can hold complex structures like arrays or dictionaries)

These data types cover the entities and fields typically associated with NoSQL stores when storing values."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what data types Redis supports for holding values. From the context provided, it seems like they're talking about how Redis handles different kinds of data.

First, I remember that Redis can handle various data types. They mentioned strings as a common type and also lists, sets, hashes, and geospatial data. Let me break this down.

Strings are straightforward— Redis works with text values. Lists in Redis are like arrays where you store multiple elements of the same type or similar types. So that's definitely supported for values.

Then there are sets, which I think are unordered collections without duplicates. They can be useful when you need unique data and don't want to have any repeats. Sorted sets would maintain order, which might be necessary in certain applications where sequence matters.

Hashes come next. I believe Redis uses hashes as keys or values, but the key here is that they're from string to string mappings. So instead of using strings as keys (like in a traditional hash map), you can use them for other data types, making it easier to handle different kinds of data efficiently.

Lastly, geospatial data with similarity. This probably refers to handling locations or coordinates. I know that in geospatial applications, having precise coordinates is essential because any mistake could lead to incorrect results. Redis supports geospatial data types which can store latitude and longitude values accurately.

I'm not sure about other data types they might support. Maybe some complex structures or specific types of strings? Also, are there any other types beyond the ones mentioned that I should consider? It would be helpful to list all possible types but for now, I think the key points are covered in the context provided.

Redis supports several data types for holding values, including:

1. **Strings**: Text and binary sequences.
2. **Lists**: Ordered collections of elements.
3. **Sets**: Unordered, unique collection of elements (or similar type).
4. **Sorted Sets**: Ordered sets without duplicates.
5. **Hashes**: Strings mapped to strings.
6. **Geospatial Data 20**: For geospatial coordinates with similarity.

These types allow for flexible data management and are well-suited for various applications requiring diverse data handling needs."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|1|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
