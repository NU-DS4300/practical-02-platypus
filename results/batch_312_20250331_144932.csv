Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was released based on the provided context. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, looking at the chunks under ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"", I see a section about Redis in the chapter called Redis DB. It mentions that Redis is an in-memory database system and is originally developed in 2009 using C++. That's a solid starting point. The next chunk from the same file says it was designed for real-time analytics, which gives some context on its initial purpose.

Next, looking at ""Redis + Python.pdf"", the first page of this document discusses Redis as a client for Python. It also mentions that Redis is maintained by the Redis Company itself and lists several GitHub repositories related to Redis, like redis/redis-py. This further confirms that Redis was developed from the start but was sold to the company.

The 4300 Conda Environment section talks about Redis being part of a standard Python environment provided by the project. That supports the idea that Redis has been around since at least 2009, even though it became a commercial product later on.

Looking at ""Redis in DS/ML 15 Source: https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/"", this is a machine learning course that uses Redis as the feature store. Since this is an educational context and the document mentions Redis was sold to the company, it's likely that Redis started being used for commercial purposes much later than its original development.

Putting all this together: The original development was in 2009, but Redis became a commercial product when the project was bought by Redis. The subsequent documentation and documentation files like madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/ also indicate that Redis has been used for several years now.

Redis began being developed in 2009 using C++. It was initially designed for real-time analytics but was later sold to the Redis Company, which now operates it. The document also mentions Redis is a client for Python and part of a standard Python environment via Conda. Additionally, machine learning courses like madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/ use Redis as the feature store, further supporting its commercial use.

Answer: Redis was developed in 2009 by the project owner before being sold to Redis."|redis|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Redis was actually released. The user has provided a bunch of context files and queries. Let me go through each one carefully.

First, looking at the query it's asking about Redis's release date. Now, in the context, they mention that Redis is an open-source in-memory database system. But I remember that Open Source Communities (OSCs) don't typically list specific release dates for their products. Instead, they usually list features or versions.

In the context provided, there are multiple files related to Redis, but none of them directly mention Redis's release date. The closest is from a 2009 document that says Redis was developed in C++ and started in 2009. So, maybe that's an approximate time frame when it began development.

However, without direct information on Redis's official launch, I can't be certain about the exact year. But based on the other documents mentioned, like ""Redis Intro"" and the Python documentation, it seems Redis was released in 2009, as that's when it started in C++. So perhaps that's a safe assumption.

I should consider whether there are any other sources or context files that might clarify this. Looking at the other documents, none of them discuss Redis's release date specifically beyond what's mentioned earlier. It's possible that Redis was indeed released around 2009 as an initial product development phase.

The Redis database was initially developed in C++ starting from 2009. Therefore, it can be assumed that Redis was released or at least started development around 2009.

**Answer:** Redis was released starting from 2009."|pgvector|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Redis was released. Let me start by reading through the context provided. The query is asking about when Redis was first released.

Looking at the context, there are a couple of documents mentioned. One is ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 18 and another is ""Redis in Context 13"". Both mention Redis. In the first document, it says that Redis was originally developed in 2009 by C++ developers. That's a big jump from now.

In the second document, ""Redis-py"" is listed as the standard client for Python on page 2. The context also mentions that Redis has been around since 2005. This seems conflicting with the first mention of 2009.

I think I need to clarify this. Redis was indeed developed in 2004, according to Wikipedia, but perhaps there's confusion between versions or different sources. On the other hand, the documents here specifically say it started in 2009. This inconsistency needs attention.

The query is asking for the release date, so I should consider both possibilities: maybe 2005 as per ""Redis-py"", which is more recent, but according to Redis's original developer, 2004. However, since both documents are from different years, it might be best to state that Redis was initially developed in 2009 and has since been updated.

I should probably go with the information from ""Redis-py"" since it's a more modern client for Python, which is the context provided. Therefore, I'll say Redis was released around mid-2009 or 2005, but mainly 2009 based on the document.
</think>

According to the provided context, Redis was initially developed in 2009 by C++ developers. However, a more recent mention in ""Redis-py"" indicates that Redis was around mid-2009 or 2005. To align with modern Python usage as highlighted in the document, Redis was released approximately in 2009.

**Answer:** Redis was first released in early 2009."|chroma|bge-m3|5000|500|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
