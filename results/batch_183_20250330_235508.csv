* Reboot: Restarting an instance without losing data on the root volume.
* Terminate: Permanently deleting the instance.

These lifecycle stages are mentioned across different pages and chunks of the document, indicating their relevance to understanding the EC2 lifecycle."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
