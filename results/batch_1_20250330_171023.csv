Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The user is asking how many databases Redis supports. I need to look at the context they provided and find relevant information.

Looking at the context, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That's a clear number there, so that's probably the answer. There's also some info about how Redis works with k/v pairs and direct interaction commands, but that doesn't affect the count.

The query is pretty straightforward. The context directly gives the number of databases Redis supports. I don't see any other information in the context that would change this number. So, I can confidently say that Redis has 16 databases by default.

From the provided context:

""The document mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15.""

Answer: Redis supports 16 databases.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let's see... The context mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases, numbered from 0 to 15. It also says they don't have a specific name associated with them and that direct interaction is through commands related to k/v pairs. There are no other mentioned names or details about the languages available. So, the key information here is the number of default databases. That should be straightforward.

I remember seeing some information online before about Redis supporting multiple databases, but I'm not exactly sure how many. Let me think. The context clearly states 16, which includes all numbers from 0 to 15. Since it's just mentioning the count and not adding any additional details about other functionalities or languages, I can confidently say that Redis supports 16 databases.

Alright, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let's see... The query is about this specific piece of text. 

First, looking at the context, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. They are numbered from 0 to 15. It also states there's no other name associated with them beyond that numbering range. So, directly, Redis supports a total of 16 distinct databases.

I don't see any other information about how many they have beyond the count and their range. The number provided is already given as 16 in the text, so I can confidently say that Redis supports 16 databases.
