"Based on the provided context, I can answer your query accurately.

According to the text, the value data types supported by Redis are:

1. **Strings**
2. **Lists** (linked lists)
3. **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements)
4. **Sorted Sets**
5. **Hashes** (string → string)
6. **Geospatial data**

"A Redis expert question!

According to the context, Redis supports the following data types for values:

1. **Strings**: a sequence of characters
2. **Lists** (linked lists): an ordered collection of strings
3. **Sets** (unique unsorted string elements): a set of unique strings
4. **Sorted Sets**: a set of unique strings with a score associated with each element, allowing for sorting and retrieval based on the scores
5. **Hashes** (string → string): a mapping of strings to strings

These data types are used as values in Redis key-value pairs."|pgvector|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
