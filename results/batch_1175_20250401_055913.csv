Alright, let me try to figure out how to answer this query about how many databases Redis supports. I remember the user gave a context about Redis, and it seems like they're looking for information on Redis's database capabilities.

First, going through the context, I see that the page mentions Redis provides 16 default databases by default. The number is listed as from 0 to 15. That part is pretty clear, so I can note that down. 

But wait, there was a mention of ""RV store"" on page 23. RV stands for Remote Virtual Store, which means it's an in-memory database used primarily with Redis. So does RV count as one database or multiple? From the context, it seems like RV is considered a single database because it's designed to handle both key-value and related data types.

Looking back at page 12, it says ""RV store"" on Redis. That reinforces that it's a primary database used in conjunction with other stores like KV, DB, ML, etc. So Redis has multiple ""databases,"" but each is referred to as a single RV store for simplicity.

So combining the two points: Redis has 16 default databases (0-15) and one RV store (which can be considered another database or part of the main collection). I think the answer should mention that there are 16 main KV stores but also highlight that there's an RV store which is a single database.

Wait, does Redis have multiple types beyond just the main ones? I see in page 17 it lists Redis as one of many possible databases, so yes. So Redis supports 16 main KV databases and 1 RV store, making it effectively 17 for some contexts but perhaps 16 if considering each database separately.

The user's query is asking how many databases Redis supports, not the number of types or components. Since Redis uses these 16 main ones as its base, that's the answer they're looking for.
</think>

Redis supports 16 main KV stores (0 to 15) plus one RV store, making it effectively 17 databases in many contexts but primarily supporting the 16 KV store types.

Answer: Redis supports 16 main KV stores and 1 RV store, totaling 17 databases."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. I remember reading some context about Redis in the previous documents, but I need to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, from the context, I see that Redis provides 16 default databases. They are numbered from 0 to 15. That's a lot! Each of these is referred to as k/v pairs, which makes sense because they store multiple key-value stores simultaneously. So, each database is its own in-memory data structure.

I also read about Redis being a KV store, which means it's designed to handle both keys and values efficiently. It can be used with other models like Graph or Full Text Search, but that doesn't change the number of databases it supports. Each database name is distinct, so even though they're all interconnected, each one is separate.

The documents mentioned Redis being part of db-engines.com, which ranks KV stores first. That confirms that each database is a dedicated KV store, not just an aggregate or connected in some way. So, 16 is the number I'm looking for.

I also came across a section about Redis in ML and DS/ML, where they mention simplified examples and feature stores. These are all instances of Redis's various functionalities but don't reduce the number of databases it supports. It's still the same 16 databases providing different services within Redis.

So putting it all together, Redis by default supports 16 distinct databases, each handling multiple key-value pairs. This allows it to be highly scalable and efficient for a wide range of applications.

Redis supports 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15. These are dedicated in-memory data structures designed as KV stores, providing various functionalities such as graph support, time-series processing, feature stores, etc., all within the Redis ecosystem."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through each section carefully.

First, looking at page 22 of the document about NoSQL databases, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default with no other names associated. That's a big number! So Redis has these 16 in-memory storage units managed as databases.

Next, on page 23, there's information about how Redis interacts with the k/v pairs. It talks about direct commands and variations for setting and getting k/v data, which I think refers to key-value stores like MongoDB or Cassandra. That doesn't add any additional databases beyond the 16 already mentioned.

Then in the NoSQL Intro document, on page 22 again, it states that Redis is a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc., without additional databases. So even when combined with these other data models, Redis still acts as a single database system.

Looking at the section about Redis and Python, specifically in NoSQL + KV DBs.pdf on page 17, it mentions Redis is primarily a KV store but can handle other models. This further supports that Redis alone supports multiple databases, specifically the 16 mentioned earlier.

So putting this together: Redis by itself manages 16 databases through its structure as an in-memory storage system. When combined with other data models, these 16 remain as core databases. There are no additional databases beyond those 16 that Redis directly supports or handles.
</think>

Redis supports a total of **16 databases** by default. These are managed within the system's in-memory storage structure and can be utilized to support various data models such as KV stores, graphs, spatial data, vectors, and time series data without requiring additional databases beyond these 16."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
