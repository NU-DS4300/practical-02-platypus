Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking through the context provided and see if any of the documents mention this specifically.

First, in the section about ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011)"", it clearly states that Neo4j's Cypher language was created in 2011. That seems like a key point.

Then there's another document titled ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 20, chunk Neo4j - A Graph Database System..."". It mentions that Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data and is considered a no-sql database. It also talks about the ACID compliance and distributed computing support.

Another document from ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 0, chunk DS 4300 ...)"", it refers to Apache Spark and Neo4j, noting that they use graph algorithms in practical examples with a book by Needham and Hodler from Northeastern University. It doesn't specifically mention the version or creation year for Neo4j itself.

So, putting this together, while the context does mention 2011 when Neo4j's Cypher language was introduced, there isn't an explicit reference to the ""version"" of Neo4j here. Therefore, I can only confirm that Neo4j was introduced in 2011 based on the provided information.

Neo4j's graph query language, specifically Cypher, was first introduced in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Hmm, the context provided includes several documents about Neo4j, but none directly mention when it was created. Let me go through each document one by one.

First, the document from page 2 of ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011 - Goal: SQL-equivalent language for graph databases - Provides a visual way of matching patterns and relationships (nodes)-[:CONNECT_TO]->(otherNodes) - APOC Plugin - Awesome Procedures on Cypher - Add-on library that provides hundreds of procedures and functions - Graph Data Science Plugin - provides efﬁcient implementations of common graph)"" mentions that the query language was created in 2011. That's a key point.

Looking at the other documents: ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 1, chunk Neo4j - A Graph Database System..."" and others don't provide information about when Neo4j itself was invented. They talk more about its features and similarities with other systems like CosmoDB or Neptune.

So, based on the context given, I can see that the query language related to Neo4j was developed in 2011. The other documents are more about how Neo4j works as a graph database system but don't mention when it was created.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. 

The first part mentions ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011."" So that's pretty clear—the document was created in 2011. 

Then there are other documents about Neo4j as a graph database system. They talk about its ACID compliance, distributed computing support, and various features like indexing and relationships. But none of these seem to mention the introduction or creation of Neo4j's query language.

The third document is ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 20, chunk Neo4j - A Graph Database System..."". It also mentions ACID compliance but doesn't talk about query languages. 

Another source is from Northeastern University referencing Apache Spark and Neo4j together. The note says it's a practical example in ""DS 4300 Neo4j Mark Fontenot, PhD..."" with similarity scores around 177-180.

Then there's another document about graph algorithms using Apache Spark and Neo4j from Northeastern University again, referencing the same material. The note says it's a practical example in ""DS 4300 Neo4j Mark Fontenot, PhD..."" with similarity scores around 177-180.

Putting this all together, the first document explicitly states that the graph query language was created (or developed) in 2011. The other documents are about how Neo4j is used as a graph database system but don't provide information on when its query language itself was introduced or invented. So, I think the answer should be based on that first document.
