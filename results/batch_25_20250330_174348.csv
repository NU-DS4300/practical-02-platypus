Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me start by reading through each of the provided documents.

First, there's a document about NoSQL Intro and KV DBs.pdf. It mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. They don't specify any other names associated with them. So that's straightforwardâ€”Redis has 16 databases.

Next, the document on Redis DB says that Redis is an open-source in-memory database system. It primarily supports KV stores but can also be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. The next section about Redis ranking by KB/second mentions it can handle up to 100,000 SET operations per second, which shows its speed and capability.

Looking at the last document from NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 19), it's about Redis Data Types Keys. It doesn't mention anything about the number of databases Redis supports beyond what was already stated in the first document. The other documents are either about Python integration or Redis Data types, which don't directly relate to database support.

So, putting this together, Redis is mentioned as having 16 default databases in the first document. Even though there's no direct information from subsequent parts that mention additional databases, the main point is the number of default ones.

Redis provides 16 default databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. The other documents discuss Redis as an open-source system, its primary use cases, performance metrics, and Python integration but do not provide further information on the number of supported databases beyond this.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let me look through the context step by step.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro"" document, it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default. These are numbered from 0 to 15. The context also says there's no other name associated with them, so they're just referred to as 0-15.

Looking further down into more detailed information about Redis, I see a part that says Redis is an in-memory database system but mentions it can be very fast with over 100,000 set operations per second. It also specifies that Redis doesn't handle complex data and only supports simple lookups by key, which aligns with the 16 databases idea.

In the ""Redis + Python"" document on GitHub, it's mentioned that Redis-py is the standard client for Python. This reinforces that Redis is widely used as a client in various programming languages and environments.

There's also information about Redis Data Types where I see keys can be strings or other types like lists, sets, etc. However, this doesn't directly answer how many databases Redis supports. It just explains how they work with different data types.

So, putting it together, the key point from the first part of the context is that Redis provides 16 databases by default for in-memory use. The other sections about speeds and languages don't add more information on the number of supported databases but rather details about Redis's capabilities and its integration into Python environments.

Redis supports 16 databases, numbered from 0 to 15, which are provided by Redis as an in-memory database system.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis actually supports based on the provided context. Let me go through each relevant part step by step.

First, there's a section about Redis Database and Interaction with Redis providing 16 databases by default. The text mentions they are numbered from 0 to 15 without any other names associated. So that immediately tells me that Redis has at least 16 databases.

Next, I see another part discussing Redis as an in-memory database system. It explains that Redis supports durability of data through snapshots and append-only files, which can be rolled forward if there's a failure. This is mentioned on page 23.

Looking further down, the text talks about Redis' ranking among KV (Key-Value) stores. It mentions that Redis primarily functions as a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, and Time Series, even though it doesn't handle complex data structures like secondary indexes.

I also notice there's a section about Redis' command list on page 3. The commands are categorized under different data structures: lists, sets, hashes, etc., but the focus here is on how many databases they support. From the first paragraph, I can see it mentions 16 databases explicitly.

The other parts of the context don't add anything new; they just provide more details about Redis' functionality and its various aspects without changing the number of supported databases. The mention of geospatial data is a side note on page 20 but doesn't affect the count.

So, putting it all together, Redis supports 16 databases by default, as explicitly stated in the first paragraph. The other sections just explain how Redis operates with these databases and their features but don't change that number.
