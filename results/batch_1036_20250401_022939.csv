"A query about a popular in-memory database! According to the provided context, I found relevant information on page 12 of the ""From 06 - Redis + Python.pdf"" document, which states that Redis is primarily a Key-Value (KV) store. However, this doesn't directly answer your question.

Upon further searching through the same PDF (page 14), I found a mention of Redis being called a ""data structure server"", but no specific release date was mentioned.

Luckily, page 1 of the same PDF mentions Redis-py, the standard client for Python, which is maintained by the Redis Company itself. Although not explicitly stating the release date, it does provide some insight into the company's involvement in the development of Redis.

After carefully reviewing the provided context, I did not find a specific mention of when Redis was released. Therefore, my answer to your question is:

"Based on the context, I don't know the exact release date of Redis. However, according to the text from page 12 of the ""Redis + Python.pdf"" file (chunk Redis in Context 13), Redis is sometimes called a data structure store and primarily a key-value store, but can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, Vector, and Time Series. There's no specific mention of the release date in this context.

If you're looking for more information on when Redis was released, I'd recommend checking out the official Redis documentation or searching online for ""Redis release date""."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|5|llama3:8b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
