Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The user mentioned a PDF titled ""Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default."" That immediately tells me that Redis has a total of 16 databases set up as default. 

I also came across another document about Redis with Python, which says Redis-py is maintained by Redis and is the standard client for Python. It's available in Conda Environments. However, this doesn't mention additional databases beyond the 16 it already has.

Looking at other sections, there's a part talking about Redis as an in-memory database system that supports durability with snapshots or append-only files. This further confirms that Redis is designed to handle data efficiently without requiring extensive disk space, which might mean fewer databases.

I also see mentions of other NoSQL databases like MongoDB, but those are not directly related to the question about Redis. The context doesn't mention any additional services or languages that Redis supports beyond its default set, so it's safe to assume Redis primarily relies on these 16 pre-defined databases.

Additionally, I recall reading somewhere that Redis can support multiple versions of itself through different flavors, which are like packages with similar functions but slightly different APIs. That would increase the total number beyond 16, making me more confident in saying there are at least 17. But since the initial text says 16 databases by default, I think the question is asking about those defaults rather than additional versions.

So putting it all together, Redis primarily supports 16 databases as its base setup.

Redis primarily supports 16 databases as its base setup. These are distributed across different flavors and can be used to scale or customize the product for specific needs.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me start by recalling the context provided. The user mentioned that Redis provides 16 default databases from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf, and these are numbered from 0 to 15. Each of these is an in-memory database system primarily designed for key-value storage. 

Looking through the other sections, there's a mention of Redis Data Types which includes things like strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, etc., but that doesn't directly answer the number of databases it supports. The context also talks about Redis being a remote directory server and mentions that Redis itself isn't a database; it's an engine or framework for other languages.

The query is straightforward: ""How many databases does Redis support?"" So from the provided information, I know that Redis has 16 default databases associated with it. These are all related to data storage as key-value pairs. Even though Redis doesn't have its own database structure, those 16 are used for storing and managing data in various applications.

I don't see any additional notes or sections that suggest Redis supports more than these 16. The other parts of the context talk about Redis being an engine for Python, which is just related to how it can be used in different programming languages, but that doesn't add to the number of databases it's known for.

So putting it all together, Redis primarily has 16 databases built into its system, each designed for key-value storage. The mention of other data structures and commands was about the language libraries available, which is a separate topic.

Redis supports 16 default databases, each named from 0 to 15, providing in-memory KV store solutions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many databases Redis supports. The context provided is from a PDF about Redis, and it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases by default. It gives some details about the structure of Redis, like it's an in-memory database system, durability with snapshots or append-only files, its speed, various data types, and how it interacts with Python for use cases.

Looking at the query: ""How many databases does Redis support?"" The context clearly states that Redis supports 16 default databases. It doesn't mention anything about additional databases beyond these 16. So, I think the answer is simply 16.
