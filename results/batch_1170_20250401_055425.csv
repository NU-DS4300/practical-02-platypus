Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about AVL trees.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced and operations like insertion, deletion, and search can be done in O(log n) time. But sometimes imbalances occur when this property isn't maintained.

I remember there are different types of imbalances. The main ones I've heard about are 'left-skewed' and 'right-skewed'. These happen when all the tree's height is on one side, leading to maximum imbalance. But what about other types?

Wait, maybe it's 'rotated unbalanced' or something like that? No, I think there's a term for more severe imbalances. Oh! It's called 'unbalanced' because of the node balance in both left and right subtrees.

So if an AVL tree is unbalanced, but not completely skewed, perhaps the imbalance is due to uneven rotations needed to rebalance it. Let me think: when inserting or deleting nodes, you might cause the height difference between children to increase beyond one, which breaks the AVL property. To fix this, you need multiple rotations.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe 'unbalanced' just refers to imbalances that require more than a single rotation? Or is there a specific term for such cases?

Oh! There's something called 'rotated unbalanced trees'. But I think the main point is that when an AVL tree isn't perfectly balanced but still maintains the balance property, like having a left-left or right-right imbalance, you need multiple rotations to rebalance.

So, in summary, imbalances where both left and right subtrees are too high require two rotations. That's the key.
</think>

The imbalances that require multiple rotations in an AVL tree occur when there's an uneven distribution of nodes on either side of a node. Specifically, when the height difference between the left and right subtree exceeds one, but isn't completely skewed (i.e., neither all nodes are on one side nor both subtrees have equal height), you need two rotation steps to restore balance.

Answer: The imbalances that require multiple rotations in an AVL tree occur when there's a node where the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by more than one, requiring two rotations to rebalance."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about AVL trees. An AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one for every node. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which in turn helps maintain efficient operations like insertion and deletion.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree occur when a node's left subtree height exceeds its right subtree height or vice versa, leading to a difference greater than one. The query is about what kind of these imbalances require multiple rotations to fix.

I remember that the standard rotation method for rebalancing involves either a single right rotation or a single left rotation. But not all cases can be fixed with just one rotation because sometimes more adjustments are needed.

For example, if an AVL tree has two consecutive nodes where each node's subtree is too deep in one direction, then just rotating one node might fix the immediate imbalance but create another problem elsewhere down the tree. So, to correct that, a second rotation is necessary. This would require considering multiple levels of the tree.

Let me think about an example. Suppose I have two nodes where both subtrees are at their maximum height difference. The root needs to perform one left rotation, which brings it closer, but now the other side also becomes too imbalanced. So, another rotation is needed here. This can cascade and require multiple levels of rotations.

In contrast, certain imbalances can be fixed by a single rotation without affecting other parts of the tree. For instance, if an AVL tree has only one node with a height difference, it's a straightforward imbalance that requires just one left or right rotation to fix.

So, the key is when the problem isn't confined to a single subtree but affects multiple levels. This situation necessitates using multiple rotations.
</think>

The imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations occur when the problem spans more than one level of the tree. For example, if two consecutive nodes have subtrees too deep in either direction, rotating one node fixes the immediate imbalance but creates another issue elsewhere. To correct this, a second rotation is necessary, which can involve adjusting multiple levels down. This necessitates considering more than just single-level rotations.

**Answer:** Imbalances requiring multiple rotations occur when the problem affects more than one level of the tree."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations to fix. Let's start by recalling what I know about AVL trees. An AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which helps maintain efficient operations like insertion and deletion.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree occur when the heights of the left and right subtrees of a node are not equal. There are two types of imbalances: one where the right subtree is taller by one or more levels, and another where the left subtree is shorter. These imbalances can cause the tree to become unbalanced and require rotations to correct.

I remember that when the right subtree is too tall (right imbalance), we need to move the root from the right subtree up higher in the tree. Similarly, if the left subtree is too short (left imbalance), we might need to move the root from the left subtree. Each rotation helps balance the tree by adjusting these imbalances.

The key here is that when an AVL tree has a single level of imbalance, one rotation can fix it. But what happens when there are multiple levels of imbalance? Let's think about this step by step.

Suppose I have a node where the right subtree is too tall (right imbalance). In such cases, I need to perform a right rotation. This move involves taking the right child and moving its parent up, effectively rebalancing the tree by adjusting the heights on either side of the root. After this rotation, the tree becomes balanced again because the new height difference between the children is now within one.

On the other hand, if I encounter a left imbalance (left subtree too short), perhaps through multiple levels, I might need to perform several rotations. Each time there's an imbalance that can't be fixed with just one rotation, another rotation is necessary. The idea here is to first fix the immediate imbalance and then address any subsequent issues that arise after adjusting the root.

I'm a bit fuzzy on how exactly multiple imbalances are handled. I think when you have a left or right imbalance, you only rotate once because moving the root up from either side can correct the immediate issue. But if there's more than one level of imbalance, you might need to do two rotations. For example, starting with a node where the left child is too short (left imblance). You take that root and move it higher, balancing the tree but creating another potential imbalance elsewhere.

Wait, let me clarify: moving the root up when there's a left or right imbalance will create new potential imbalances on either side. So after one rotation, we might have another level of imbalance. Therefore, for each single-level imblance, you only need one rotation to fix it. For multiple levels, you might need more rotations.

So, the main point is that when an AVL tree has a height difference of two or more between its left and right subtree at any node, it requires multiple rotations to rebalance it. Each rotation can address only a single level of imbalance, so if there are multiple imbalances, you'll need to perform several rotations in sequence.

To summarize, the key reason for needing multiple rotations is that when an AVL tree has imbalances that require more than one level adjustment, each rotation fixes only part of the problem. This makes it essential to sequentially apply rotations until all nodes meet the height balance requirement.
</think>

The correct answer is: When an AVL tree experiences an imbalance that requires multiple levels of correction, each single-level imbalance necessitates a specific rotation, and after completing these rotations, additional imbalances may arise. Thus, multiple rotations are required due to sequential adjustments needed.

**Answer:** Multiple rotations are necessary when the AVL tree has multiple levels of imbalance. Each rotation fixes one level of imbalance, which can lead to new imbalances that require further rotations until all nodes balance."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|500|50|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
