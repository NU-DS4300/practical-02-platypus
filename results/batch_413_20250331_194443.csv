Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The user is asking me to name the data types supported by Redis for values. They provided a lot of context about Redis, specifically from two PDFs and some Python documentation. 

First, I should look through the context they gave. There are chunks about Redis Data Types Keys and Redis DB sections. From page 19 in the first PDF, it mentions that the primary value type is strings with specific details on values like Strings, Lists, Sets, etc., but it doesn't list all the data types supported.

In the section titled ""Redis Database and Interaction,"" Redis is described as providing 16 databases by default. They can be accessed via a set of commands related to KV pairs and variations. The main point here is about how they interact with other languages, mentioning Python in their documentation on page 23. But there's no explicit list of data types they support.

So putting this together, I need to inform the user that while Redis does have certain value types like Strings, Lists, Sets, etc., it doesn't explicitly list all possible data types for values. It's more about providing a KV store and supporting various interactions rather than a comprehensive list of supported types.
</think>

The context provided does not explicitly list all the data types Redis supports. However, it does mention that Redis primarily works with strings as value types, lists (linked lists), sets (unsorted unique string elements), hashes (string to string mappings), and geospatial data.

Answer: 

Redis primarily supports value types such as Strings, Lists, Sets, and Geospatial data. It provides functionalities for these types but does not explicitly list all possible data types it supports."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out what data types Redis supports for values based on the context provided. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at page 19 of NoSQL Intro.pdf, it mentions that Redis Data Types have Keys as strings but can be any binary sequence, so that's covered. The Values are listed as Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, and Geospatial data with similarity 0.31.

Then on page 22, the same section talks about Direct Interaction using commands like set, get, incr, etc., which helps confirm that they're handling strings, lists, sets, and similar constructs. 

In Redis + Python.pdf, in pages 5-7, I see examples of mset and mget functions. mset allows storing multiple values into a key, while mget retrieves them as a list. This makes sense for supporting lists.

The documentation on page 14 links to madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/, which uses feature stores like Redis in ML contexts. The commands there support strings, lists, sets, etc., so that aligns with the earlier points.

There's also a section on Redis Data Types and Keys on page 20 of NoSQL Intro.pdf, reinforcing that keys are strings but can be other binary sequences, and values include strings, lists, sets, etc.

I don't see any mention of other data types like time series, vector, or geospatial in the provided context. The focus is mostly on standard data structures with strings as keys and supporting multiple value types.
</think>

The data types Redis supports for values are:

- **Strings**: Strings can be used as keys and as values.
- **Lists**: Lists support both sequential addition/removal of elements or bulk retrieval using functions like mget.
- **Sets**: Sets allow unique element storage, which is useful when only one instance of an element is needed, though they don't support deletions.
- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but maintain insertion order, providing a predictable structure for lookups.
- **Geospatial Data**: Geospatial data types with similarity 0.31 include geospatial coordinates and their variants, representing spatial information.

 Redis also supports other data structures like time series or vector data, which are not detailed in the provided context but may be addressed elsewhere."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.

Okay, I need to figure out how to name the data types supported by Redis for their values based on the given context. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the NoSQL Introduction document, it mentions that Redis is a KV store but can be used with other models like Graph or Time Series. The section about its database and interaction lists out 16 Redis databases and how they are numbered. It also notes that Redis supports different types of interactions, such as setting, getting, incrementing, etc.

Next, the Redis + Python PDF provides some examples of commands using Redis in a Python environment. They show setting a key with values like integers or strings, getting those values back, incrementing the count, and retrieving them again. This example highlights how Redis handles different data types for storing and retrieving values.

Putting it all together, I see that Redis supports various types of data, including strings, lists (which are akin to arrays), sets (which can have unique elements but aren't sorted), hashes, and geospatial data. The commands show operations on these types like mset, get, incr, etc., which reinforces the idea that different commands handle different data structures.

I should also consider other sources mentioned, like the NoSQL Introduction document and the Python examples, to ensure I'm not missing any specific data types or their corresponding names. From what's clear, strings are the primary type, but Redis can support lists, sets, hashes, etc., depending on how it's used with different commands.

I should avoid mentioning other languages like Ruby unless specified, since the query is about Python specifically. Also, I don't need to mention data structures or models like graphs or time series because those are separate topics not related to value types in Redis.

Finally, I'll structure my answer by listing each type of data supported by Redis and its corresponding commands as demonstrated in the examples provided.
</think>

Redis supports various data types for storing and retrieving values. Here is a list of these data types along with the relevant commands used in the context:

- **Strings**: Used directly or in mset, get, incr, etc. (e.g., r.set(""key"", ""value""), r.get(""key""))
- **Lists**: Represented as linked lists.
- **Sets**: Unique elements without sorting.
- **Hashes**: Use strings mapping to other strings.
- **Geospatial data**: Supports geospatial operations with similarity metrics.

Examples of these commands:

1. Set: `r.set('key', 'value')`
2. Get: `r.get('key')`
3. Increment: `r.incr('key')`
4. Mget with multiple keys: `r.mget('key1', key2, key3)`
5. Mset with data model: `r.mset({'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'})`

These commands demonstrate Redis's ability to handle different data types and structures efficiently."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
