Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. From the context provided, it seems like there are several documents about Neo4j and its features. The first document is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2)"", which talks about Cypher as a graph query language created in 2011. That's probably when Cypher was first released as the querying language.

The second document, ""From 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 20)"", discusses Neo4j's structure and supports various indexing methods. It also mentions that it's ACID compliant and works with distributed computing, which suggests a specific version or release around 2011.

Another document is ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 1)"", which corroborates the previous information by stating that Neo4j was created in 2011. 

The third document is about using Neo4j with Docker Compose, mentioning a similarity score of 0.45. While it doesn't directly address the invention date, it's part of the context given for research purposes and doesn't change my prior knowledge.

Additionally, the fourth document talks about DS 4300, which is a product related to Neo4j. It mentions practical examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j, but again, this information is specific to the product line and might not influence the invention date.

The fifth document provides information on graph algorithms in Neo4j based on Needham and Hodler's work. While this could imply that some of the features were developed later, it doesn't change the initial release year.

So, combining all these sources, including Cypher's creation in 2011, the introduction of the graph data model in 2010, and Neo4j being a distributed graph database around 2011, I can conclude that neo4j's graph query language was invented in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. The user provided several documents and sections related to Neo4j, which gives me some context but not the answer. Let me go through each document one by one.

First, from ""10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2)"", it talks about Cypher, a graph query language created in 2011. That seems like an important point because Neo4j's graph system was built on this language. The year is listed as 2011, which might be the invention year.

The next document ""09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 20)"" mentions that Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data. It also talks about various types of indexing and ACID compliance. However, this doesn't directly address when Cypher was created or introduced as the query language.

Another document is from ""10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 1)"", which again refers to the creation date for Cypher in 2011. It also notes similar features in other graph databases like Microsoft CosmoDB and Amazon Neptune, with similarity scores of 0.41 each. This suggests that Neo4j adopted many functionalities from these systems at a time when they were still in development.

The Docker Compose section from ""10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 3)"" mentions that Neo4j was also introduced in Docker Compose 4 with a similarity score of 0.45. Since Docker is a containerization platform, it's possible that the introduction of Neo4j in this context was part of its development timeline.

Looking at the ""DS 4300 Neo4j Mark Fontenot..."" document, it discusses graph algorithms and practical examples using Apache Spark and Neo4j. The mention of similar features in other systems supports the idea that Neo4j's Cypher query language evolved around 2011 to integrate with existing technologies.

The introduction section from ""09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" talks about supporting both transactional and analytical processing, which could have been a driving factor for Neo4j's design. It also mentions various types of indexing and ACID compliance, which are key database features that were likely influenced by the Cypher language.

Putting it all together, even though some documents don't explicitly state when Cypher was introduced (only mentioning 2011), others provide evidence that Neo4j adopted these functionalities around then. The context also references other graph databases that used similar query languages in their development, which further supports the idea that Neo4j's graph query language started around 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was introduced around 2011 when it was created as part of the project. This period is consistent with its integration with other systems and technologies mentioned in the provided context, which support similar functionalities such as transactional and analytical processing."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neo4j and its features.

From the context provided, there are several documents written about Neo4j. The first one is from page 2 of Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher. That should be where the Cypher language itself is introduced or discussed in detail. 

The other documents talk about Neo4j as a graph database system, which supports both transactional and analytical processing. They also mention various features like APOC plugins, the Graph Data Science Plugin, and similarity scores for different databases.

Looking at these, it's clear that Neo4j was developed by a team, possibly with the help of open-source initiatives like APOC. The Cypher language is one of the core components introduced in one of those documents, which suggests it was created during that time frame.

The documents also reference other graph databases and their similarities, but that's more about how Neo4j stands against them rather than when Cypher was developed itself.

I don't see any references to newer versions or updates beyond the provided context, so I can infer that the key point is the introduction of Cypher in one of the documents. 

Additionally, considering common sources and trends, Neo4j's development aligns with the growing interest in graph databases as a solution for complex data challenges. The availability of Cypher alongside APOC plugins indicates its practical implementation and community support.

So, putting it all together, I believe Cypher was introduced during the development phase of Neo4j, specifically around 2011 when they first released the system.

Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was introduced around early 2011. 

**Answer:** Cypher was invented in early 2011 as part of Neo4j's development."|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
