Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the context provided. Let's look through each of the provided documents and see where relevant information is.

First document is about NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf from page 22. It mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default with numbers 0 to 15, but it doesn't specify how many they actually support beyond that. So this might not directly answer the question.

Next, another document on page 17 talks about Redis being an open-source in-memory database primarily known as a KV store. It also mentions Redis can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc., but it doesn't specify how many databases it supports. So again, this is not directly helpful for the count.

The third document on page 12 discusses Redis in the context of a Python repository, and there's a mention of ""16 databases"" here too. But since the previous two documents don't clearly state the number, I'm unsure if that's accurate or just a paraphrase.

Looking further, the fourth document from page 17 refers to Redis DB ranking, which mentions it is in the top 4 KV stores but doesn't provide a count of supported databases.

The fifth source on page 13 provides a simplified example of Redis being used in ML with libraries like feature form and madamLD. However, this isn't giving any information about database support counts either.

Lastly, the document from page 14 explains how Redis is used in DS/ML with feature stores. It also doesn't specify the number of databases it supports.

After reviewing all these sources, I notice that three documents mention Redis as providing 16 databases: two are parts of the same PDF or different sections but don't explicitly state the count. Without clear information from any of them, I can only assume that Redis supports 16 databases based on the first document's statement.

Based on the provided context, the three documents mention Redis as providing 16 databases.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, there are several files and chunks that mention Redis. 

First, on page 22 of the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" by similarity 0.16, it says Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. So that's a clear number here.

Then in another file at page 23 with similarity 0.16, it mentions direct interaction commands related to k/v pairs and variations. That doesn't add any new information on the total supported databases.

Looking further into ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 23, it lists Redis as one of many databases provided for Open Source, with a ranking of KV stores at position 18. This reinforces that Redis is among 16 default databases for Redis.

Additionally, in the file ""Redis + Python.pdf"" from page 12 to 14, there are sources about Redis being used in ML and DS/ML. The content discusses how Redis interacts with feature stores and uses it as a data structure store. This doesn't change the count of supported databases but explains how they're used.

So, combining all these sources, Redis supports 16 default databases numbered from 0 to 15.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. From the context provided, I'll start by looking through each relevant paragraph.

First, in the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" section on page 22, it mentions that Redis provides 16 default databases. These are numbered from 0 to 15. That's a clear number right there.

Then, moving to ""Redis DB - Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database..."", the section says there are 18 KV stores by default. However, it also notes that Redis can be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, Full Text Search, etc., but it's primarily focused on KV stores.

In ""Redis + Python.pdf"", it refers to Redis in context 13 and mentions that Redis supports durability features a. saving snapshots to disk or b. append-only file which is a journal for roll-forward if there's a failure. So this reinforces the idea that Redis is an in-memory database system.

Additionally, on page 19, it talks about Redis being very fast with over 100,000 SET operations per second and supporting lookup by key without secondary indexes. This gives more context about its functionality but doesn't change the number of databases it supports.

Putting all this together, Redis has 16 default databases as stated in the first paragraph. The other mentions about durability features are about how these databases support certain functionalities but don't add to their count.
