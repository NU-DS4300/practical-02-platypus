"According to the provided context, the EC2 lifecycle consists of four stages:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: This allows you to temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: This permanently deletes the instance.
4. **Reboot**: This restarts an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.
