Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree require multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what an AVL tree is. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, which helps maintain efficient insertion and deletion operations because they are O(log n) time.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree occur when either the left subtree is deeper than the right or vice versa. The height difference being more than one triggers a need for rebalancing. I remember that rebalancing involves rotations to restore the balance. But how exactly does it work?

I think there are two main types of unbalanced nodes: those with too many nodes on one side and others where the imbalance is spread across multiple levels. Let me consider an example where the right subtree is much deeper than the left. That would cause a significant imbalance, requiring more rotations.

Let's say we have a node with four left children but only two right children. The left subtree is taller by two levels. To fix this, I believe we might need to move some nodes from the right side up higher or down lower. For instance, if the root has an unbalanced right subtree, we can perform rotations on that node to rebalance it.

Alternatively, another type of imbalance could be a chain where one side is much deeper than the other at multiple levels, not just two levels apart. In such cases, more than one rotation might be necessary, or maybe even several steps are needed to fix the structure.

I should also remember about different types of imbalances: left-heavy and right-heavy. Each requires specific rotations depending on how deep the imbalance is. For example, a node with a single level difference between subtrees can require just a single rotation, but if it's two levels deeper, more steps are needed because you have to propagate that imbalance down.

Wait, I think the key factor here is the depth of the imbalance relative to the tree height. The more balanced the imbalance, the fewer rotations are needed. But for larger imbalances, like when one subtree is significantly taller than the other, multiple rotations might be necessary.

So, putting it all together, imbalances in an AVL tree that require multiple rotations typically occur at nodes where the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by two or more levels. This means that we need to perform a series of rotations—either moving nodes from the deeper side up higher or down lower—to restore balance.

I should also mention the specific types: single rotation versus multiple rotations. A single rotation can fix an imbalance where one subtree is only one level deeper than the other, while larger imbalances might require two or more rotations to correct.

In an AVL tree, imbalances that require multiple rotations occur at nodes where the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by two or more levels. This situation necessitates a series of rotations to restore balance. 

- **Single Rotation**: Correctly handles an imbalance where one subtree is only one level deeper than the other.
- **Multiple Rotations (Multi-Rotation)**: Required when the imbalance causes the tree height difference between subtrees to exceed two levels.

Thus, larger imbalances necessitate multiple rotations to ensure efficient operation."|redis|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause it to need multiple rotations. Let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one. This means that for every node, the balance factor (height difference between left and right subtree) should be -1, 0, or 1. If this isn't maintained, the tree can become imbalanced.

Imbalance occurs when the balance factor is more than 1 or less than -1. For example, if a node's left child is two levels deeper than its right child, that creates an imbalance because the height difference exceeds the allowed limit. This imbalance would cause issues with operations like search and insertions because the tree might not maintain its structure efficiently.

Now, how does this imbalanced state require multiple rotations? Well, when one subtree becomes too deep relative to another, we need to rebalance the tree. Let's think about two common scenarios: left rotation and right rotation.

In a scenario where the left child is deeper than the right, a single rotation (specifically, a left rotation) can bring the imbalanced node up. Rotating left involves moving the root of the right subtree under it until the height difference is maintained again.

On the other hand, if the right subtree becomes deeper, we might need to perform multiple rotations, especially if more than one level are out of balance. For instance, if both the left and right subtrees are too deep by two levels each, a single rotation wouldn't suffice. So, in such cases, perhaps two or even three rotations would be necessary.

I'm not entirely sure about all edge cases, but I think the key idea is that each imbalance requires adjustments through rotations, potentially more than one when there's significant imbalance.

In an AVL tree, imbalances occur when the height difference between the left and right subtrees of a node exceeds 1. This can lead to inefficiencies during operations due to excessive splitting or merging. To correct such imbalances, the tree may require multiple rotations.

When a single level is out of balance (e.g., one subtree is two levels deeper), a single rotation suffices—specifically, a left rotation. However, if more than one level is imbalanced, one rotation isn't enough. In such cases, adjustments might necessitate more rotations to restore the balance. This means that each level of imbalance can sometimes require multiple rotations to correct, depending on how much the tree deviates from its balanced state."|pgvector|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of imbalances in an AVL tree cause it to require multiple rotations. From the context provided, let me start by recalling what I know about AVL trees and their balance.

An AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree where each node maintains two heights: the height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree. The tree is balanced such that the difference in heights between any two adjacent nodes is at most one. This ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, which helps in maintaining efficient operations like insertion, deletion, and searching.

Now, imbalances in an AVL tree occur when a node's left or right subtree becomes significantly taller than the other, potentially leading to uneven distribution of nodes around the root. If this happens, the tree can lose its balance property, resulting in degraded performance because certain operations become O(n) instead of O(log n), which is a significant inefficiency.

Looking at the context provided, I see that from 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf (page 13, chunk Trees 14) it mentions trees being checked for balance. Specifically, when adding data, if duplicates are encountered (line: ""data would have to be duplicated → space inefﬁcient 11""), this suggests that without proper balancing, the tree can become unbalanced quickly.

From the query, I need to identify the type of imbalance causing multiple rotations. The context also mentions from 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 3, chunk a conﬂict → less efﬁcient ○ So, a locking scheme (pessimistic model) might be preferable 4) with similarity 296.96). This part talks about concurrency issues in databases but also includes an example related to real-time inference, where imbalances can cause problems.

Another point from 05 - NoSQL Intro.pdf (page 15, chunk for example, in real-time inferencing. 16) mentions that when data is inserted into a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Redis without proper balancing, it might cause issues because the tree becomes unbalanced, requiring multiple rotations to rebalance.

So putting this together: When an AVL tree (or any self-balanced structure) isn't properly maintained in terms of balance, especially after inserting or updating data that causes one side of the tree to become too tall, it leads to imbalances. These imbalances result in multiple rotations as the tree must be restructured from a left-heavy or right-heavy state back to an balanced state.

In the context provided with Trees 14 and 296.96, there's an example given where inserting into a table becomes problematic due to concurrency issues, leading to the need for multiple rotations. The linked list of tuples being sorted by specialVal in a) is also mentioned as an inefficient search method when unbalanced.

Therefore, the key imbalances that require multiple rotations are those that cause one side of the tree to grow much taller than the other, necessitating restructuring through multiple rotation steps to restore balance.
</think>

The imbalance required for multiple rotations in an AVL tree occurs when one subtree becomes significantly taller than the other. This leads to inefficiencies during operations like insertion or search, causing degraded performance. The linked list scenario and real-time inference examples illustrate this, where rebalancing is necessary through multiple rotations.

Answer: Multiple rotations are needed when one side of the AVL tree becomes too tall after an imbalance, requiring restructuring via multiple rotations to restore balance."|chroma|mxbai-embed-large|64|10|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
