"Based on the provided context, I can accurately answer that the data types supported by Redis for values are:

1. Strings
2. Lists (linked lists)
3. Sets (unique unsorted string elements)
4. Sorted Sets
5. Hashes (string → string)

These value data types are documented on page 19 of the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" file, specifically in the section titled ""Redis Data Types: Keys""."|redis|nomic-embed-text|8000|1000|1|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.
