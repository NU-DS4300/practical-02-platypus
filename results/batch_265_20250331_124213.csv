Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the provided context. Let me read through each part carefully.

Starting from page 22 of the PDF titled ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf,"" it mentions that Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered 0 to 15. So that's a key point right there— Redis offers multiple databases as part of its default setup.

Looking further down, I see another chunk on page 23 from the same document that says Redis provides 16 databases. That reinforces the idea that Redis comes with several in-memory database instances. Each is numbered from 0 to 15, which probably corresponds to a range of storage sizes and capacities.

Then, there's another section (page 18) where it explains how Redis works as a KV store but can also be used with other models like Graph, Spatial, etc. It mentions that each database instance supports multiple functionalities beyond just KV stores. But for the purpose of this query, I'm specifically asked about how many databases Redis supports in total.

I should make sure to not confuse Redis instances with Redis objects or anything else. Since the context clearly states that Redis provides 16 default databases, each numbered uniquely from 0 to 15, that's the number we're looking for.

There are a couple of other pages and chunks (pages 17-22) that talk about Redis being an in-memory database system with specific features like durability through snapshots or journaling, but these don't affect the count. They just provide additional information on how it works as a KV store alongside other models.

Additionally, I notice that page 6 of the same PDF provides more context on connecting Redis with Python using the redis library. It mentions that Redis-py is maintained by Redis and can be installed in conda environments. However, this doesn't change the number of databases Redis supports— it just tells me how to use the library.

So putting it all together: the main point is Redis providing 16 databases by default, numbered 0 through 15. The other sections don't provide additional information relevant to the count. Therefore, the answer should be that Redis supports a total of 16 databases.

Redis provides a total of 16 databases by default, each uniquely numbered from 0 to 15. These are primarily used as in-memory KV stores but support other functionalities like Graph, Spatial, etc.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports based on the given context. Let me go through each paragraph and look for any mention of databases.

Starting from page 22, it says Redis provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. That's a clear number there. 

Looking further down, in some sections, like the ""Redis DB - Redis (Remote Directory Server) - Open source, in-memory database"" paragraph on page 17, it mentions that Redis supports various models including KV store and others like Graph, Spatial, etc. But I don't see a specific count here.

Then, another part under ""Connecting to the Server"" on page 2 says that host can be localhost or 127.0.0.1, port is set when creating the container, probably 6379. There's no mention of database numbers here, so that doesn't help with counting.

In the section about Redis-py on page 5 and onwards, it uses ""db"" from 0 to 15 and mentions it's an in-memory database, which supports K/V storage but doesn't specifically say how many databases it supports. It does mention the KV store, so that's one.

The part under ""String Commands"" on page 4 shows some commands like set, incr, hset, etc., but again, no number of databases here.

Then, in the section about Redis Pipelines on page 10, there are examples using a pipeline. The example uses ""seat:0"", ""seat:3"", and ""seat:4"" to get values, but that's more about how it works than counting databases.

In the part about Redis Data Types on page 20, it lists various types like strings, lists, sets, etc., but again, no number of databases mentioned here.

Overall, the only clear count is from page 22 where it says 16 databases. The other sections either don't mention them or refer to how they work with existing databases without providing a specific database count.

Based on the provided context, Redis supports 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. This information is clearly stated in the paragraph titled ""Redis Provides 16 Databases by Default"" on page 22.

Okay, I need to figure out how many databases Redis supports. Let me look through the context provided.

First, I see a chunk about Redis Database and Interaction - Redis provides 16 databases by default. They're numbered from 0 to 15. It doesn't mention any other types of storage or additional systems they support. The other documents seem to focus on how to connect to Redis via Python, handle data structures like KV stores, pipelining, hashes, and some ML examples.

So, the main point is that Redis supports 16 databases numbered 0 through 15. There's no mention of alternatives or other storage systems beyond the default 16.

Redis supports a total of 16 databases by default, which are numbered from 0 to 15. These are referred to as 'databases' in the document context provided.
