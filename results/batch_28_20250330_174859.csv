Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. The user provided a bunch of context files, but from what I can tell, they're all related to the Graph Data Model and the Neo4j graph database system. 

Looking at each section, the first one is about Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher. It mentions that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011 as a goal of their SQL-equivalent for graph databases. That seems like a solid point.

The next sections talk about Neo4j as a no-sql database, its ACID compliance, support for distributed computing, and specific examples with Apache Spark and the previous version called DS 4300. They also mention it's similar to Microsoft CosmoDB or Amazon Neptune but older.

There are other files too that discuss the graph data model, including the introduction from a paper by Mark Fontenot from Northeastern University, which talks about graph algorithms in Apache Spark and Neo4j, with a similarity score of 0.26. That seems related to how the query language works in Neo4j.

The previous version, DS 4300, was referenced with scores around 0.21 for both systems. So, putting this together, it looks like the main point is from the first context file where they explicitly mention that Neo4j's graph query language was created in 2011. The other parts probably explain what Neo4j offers, how it's used, and its similarities with other databases, but they don't directly answer when the query language itself was invented.

I think I should focus on the first section because that's where they state the invention year clearly. Even though the other sections provide context about the overall graph database system, the query language aspect is specifically addressed in that initial file.

The query language for Neo4j was indeed invented in 2011.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4J's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking through the provided context. The user gave a PDF about Neo4J with pages from 2 and 1. 

In page 2, it mentions ""Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011."" So that tells me that Cypher was introduced around that time. But the question is asking when Neo4J's graph query language itself was invented or first used.

Looking further into page 2, it says ""Goal: SQL-equivalent language for graph databases - Provides a visual way of matching patterns and relationships (nodes)-[:CONNECT_TO]->(otherNodes) - APOC Plugin."" It doesn't explicitly state when Cypher was created, but the context suggests that Neo4J used Cypher. I know that Cypher is a placeholder for the query language being used inside Neo4j.

Page 1 talks about Neo4j's introduction with ACID compliance and distributed computing support. That information is more general than what we need. The specific mention of Cypher in page 2 indicates that the graph query language was developed or adopted when it was introduced, which would be around 2011.

So putting this together, Neo4j's graph query language (Cypher) was invented and used starting from 2011.

Neo4J's graph query language, Cypher, was invented in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The first section is from a PDF titled ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher - Neo4j’s graph query language created in 2011."" That already gives me some information that the query language was created around that time, but I should check if this is reliable.

Looking at the subsequent sections, there are several other PDFs. The first one talks about Neo4j being a new no-sql database system that supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data. It mentions it's relatively new, classifying it as a new no-sql DB. Then another PDF (page 20) from the same series discusses the introduction to the Graph Data Model, mentioning its ACID compliance, support for various types of indexing, etc.

There are also two more PDFs from page 0 discussing practical examples using Apache Spark and Neo4j. One talks about Graph Algorithms with examples in Apache Spark, and another by Needham and Hodler uses Neo4j with a book reference. Both of these sources seem to be related to the capabilities and features of Neo4j.

Now, looking at the query: ""When was neo4j's graph query language invented?"" The context mentions that the query language was created in 2011. Additionally, the introduction to the Graph Data Model PDF discusses the introduction around page 20, which might relate to when the system was developed. But the most direct information is from the first PDF where it states that Cypher (Neo4j's graph query language) was created in 2011.

Therefore, the answer should be 2011.
