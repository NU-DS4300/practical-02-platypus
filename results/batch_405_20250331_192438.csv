"Based on the provided context, I can answer your query accurately.

According to the context, specifically from page 4 of the PDF (chunk EC2 Lifecycle), the EC2 lifecycle consists of four stages:

1. **Launch**: When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Reboot**: Restart an instance without losing the data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: Permanently delete the instance.

These four stages make up the EC2 lifecycle, allowing you to manage your instances as needed."|redis|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, I can answer your question about the EC2 lifecycle.

According to the context, specifically from page 4 of the PDF, the EC2 lifecycle includes four stages:

1. **Launch**: This is when you start an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: You can temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance by starting or stopping it.
3. **Reboot**: You can restart an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.
4. **Terminate**: Permanently delete the instance, effectively ending its lifecycle.

These stages provide a clear understanding of how you can interact with and manage your EC2 instances throughout their lifetime."|pgvector|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo.

"Based on the provided context, I can answer your question accurately.

The EC2 lifecycle refers to the different stages or states that an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance goes through during its existence. According to the context, these stages include:

1. **Launch**: When starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
2. **Start/Stop**: Temporarily suspending usage without deleting the instance.
3. **Terminate**: Permanently deleting the instance.
4. **Reboot**: Restarting an instance without affecting the data on the root volume.

These stages allow you to manage your EC2 instances according to your needs, whether it's starting a new instance, temporarily pausing an instance for maintenance, or permanently terminating an instance when it's no longer needed.

So, that's the EC2 lifecycle in a nutshell!"|chroma|bge-m3|8000|1000|5|llama3:8b|"You are an expert data engineer with a deep understanding of relational databases and NoSQL databases, including the relational model as well as Redis, Neo4j, Mongo. You are also an expert in AWS as a service.
