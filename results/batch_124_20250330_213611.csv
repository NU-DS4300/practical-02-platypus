Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The user is asking about when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. I remember from the context provided that there are several documents and pages related to Neo4j.

Looking at the first document, it mentions that Neo4j was created in 2011 under the name Cypher. It also talks about how Cypher is a graph-based query language. The other files link to different sections of this document and similar ones about the graph database system and its features.

There's another file mentioned from 09 - Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf that again refers to Neo4j with pages numbered 20, 18, and 0. These are all pointing back to the original document where it specifies that Neo4j was developed in 2011 using Cypher as the query language.

So putting this together, the key information is that Neo4j's graph query language, which is Cypher, was invented in 2011.

Neo4j's graph query language, referred to as Cypher, was invented in 2011.

Okay, I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me look through the provided context and see if there's any mention of this specific feature or timeline.

First, I notice that the context includes several documents related to Neo4j, like a PDF titled ""Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher"" on page 2. The section mentions that Neo4j is a graph database system from 2011 and supports various graph algorithms. It also talks about APOC plugins for efficient implementations of common graph algorithms with similarity scores related to how often the query language is referred to.

In another document, ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" on page 20, it refers back to this Cypher section, noting that Neo4j's graph query language was discussed in these pages. The context also includes a note about APOC plugins with similarity 0.18 and mentions other similar systems like CosmoDB or Neptune.

Looking at the ""NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf"" on page 4, it doesn't directly address Neo4j's query language invention but discusses NoSQL DBs. Similarly, MongoDB, also in a separate document, is about its structure with similarity 0.37, but again, not related to the query language.

The documents from page 1 of ""NoSQL - Introduction"" mention that NoSQL was first used by Carlo Strozzi for relational databases without SQL in the early '90s, and it's noted as a non-relational DB system. However, none of these documents specifically talk about Neo4j or its query language invention.

The last document, ""Introduction to Graph Data Model.pdf"" page 1 mentions that Neo4j supports various types of indexing and is ACID compliant with distributed computing support, referencing other systems similar to it with similarity scores around 0.38. The Cypher section in the earlier document also references APOC plugins for efficient graph algorithms.

Putting this together, the most relevant information points to the Cypher section discussing Neo4j's query language and mentioning APOC plugins with similarity scores. However, none of the provided documents explicitly state when Neo4j's query language was invented but rather describes its features. It seems that the query language itself might be a feature introduced in 2011 based on the context from ""From 10 - Neo4j.pdf (page 2, chunk Neo4j - Query Language and Plugins - Cypher)"" where it says ""Goal: SQL-equivalent language for graph databases.""

So, I'm leaning towards the query language being a feature introduced in 2011.

Okay, so I need to figure out when Neo4j's graph query language was invented. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, I see references to ""Cypher"" in Neo4j. The text mentions that Cypher is a visual way to match patterns and relationships in graphs. It also talks about APOC Plugins and an Add-on library with hundreds of procedures. So, Cypher seems like the core language or query syntax for Neo4j.

Looking further, there's a section from page 10 of ""Neo4j - A Graph Database System..."" which says that Neo4j supports both transactional and analytical processing and is ACID compliant. It also mentions supporting distributed computing. These details might not directly answer when Cypher was invented.

In the document about NoSQL databases, it mentions that the term ""NoSQL"" was introduced in 1998 by Carlo Strozzi to describe his relational database system without using SQL. But this is a broader concept of NoSQL databases and doesn't specifically refer to Neo4j or Cypher.

Looking at the Cypher section again, it says: ""Cypher - A Visual Way To Match Patterns And Relationships (Nodes)-[:CONNECT_TO]->(otherNodes)"" with an example given that shows relationships between users connected by knowledge. So, Cypher is a query language created for Neo4j, which suggests that Cypher was invented specifically as the underlying query language.

Since Neo4j was developed to handle graph data and provide a graph query language, it's reasonable to conclude that Cypher was created in its capacity as the querying syntax within Neo4j. There's no explicit mention of other query languages or systems like SQL being used for graphs, which aligns with Neo4j's approach.

Therefore, based on the context provided and the structure of the information, Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented specifically as part of its development to support graph-based data processing.
</think>

Neo4j's graph query language, known as Cypher, was invented within the system to serve as a visual framework for querying and traversing graphs. Cypher was designed to match patterns and relationships (nodes) in a graph context. This invention was specific to Neo4j, providing a methodological approach that contrasts with other SQL-based systems which focus on schema orientation.

**Answer:** Neo4j's graph query language, Cypher, was invented specifically within the system as a visual framework for querying graphs, reflecting its design to handle graph-based data processing."|chroma|nomic-embed-text|5000|500|10|deepseek-r1:1.5b|"You are a helpful AI assistant.
